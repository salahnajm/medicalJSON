Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Diagnosis is clinical or by stool culture, although polymerase chain reaction testing and immunoassays are increasingly used. Treatment is symptomatic, although some parasitic and some bacterial infections require specific anti-infective therapy.",

These symptoms usually start soon after being exposed to an allergen. Some people only get allergic rhinitis for a few months at a time because they're sensitive to seasonal allergens, such as tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round. Most people with allergic rhinitis have mild symptoms that can be easily and effectively treated. But for some symptoms can be severe and persistent, causing sleep problems and interfering with everyday life. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time, but this can take many years and it's unlikely that the condition will disappear completely.",

Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go. Within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe. Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse.

Benign brain tumors are low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly and are less likely to return after treatment. Malignant brain tumors are high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumors) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumors); they're more likely to grow back after treatment",

The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged. Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge.",

This fatigue feels very different from ordinary tiredness. It might take a day or 2 to kick in after physical, mental, or emotional exertion. ME/CFS affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups. It doesn't go away with sleep or rest and affects everyday life.

DVT usually occurs in a deep leg vein, a larger vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh. It can also occur in the pelvis or abdomen. It can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism.  DVT and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE).",

Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time. While some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it's actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. It impacts people of all genders and ages – including children. Studies show that around 4% of children  between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious. With the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.",

The patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid at first, but become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky over time. The patches may clear up on their own eventually, but this can take weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can recur.",

About 1 in 100 pregnancies are an ectopic pregnancy. Symptoms usually start when you’re about 6 weeks pregnant and can include:\\n\\n1. Pain low down and on one side of your abdomen\\n2. Bleeding from your vagina\\n3. Pain in the tip of your shoulder\\n3. Discomfort when going to the toilet\\n4. A brown watery discharge from your vagina.\\n\\nIf you have an ectopic pregnancy, unfortunately, it's not possible to save and it will likely need to be removed. Contact you doctor.",

   "description": "Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain and is defined by repeated seizures. Symptoms of epilepsy:\\nThe main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are different types of seizure, depending on which part of the brain it affects. The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.\\n\\nThe severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a \"trance-like\" state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).\\n\\nSome people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.\\n\\nPeople with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms. Seizures can occur when you're awake or asleep. The type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are:\\n\\n1. Focal (or partial) seizures – where only a small part of the brain is affected\\n2. Generalized seizures – where most or all of the brain is affected",

It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 will have it to some degree. See your doctor if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted). Erectile dysfunction can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. Physical causes include:\\n\\n-Narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis – commonly associated with high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol or diabetes\\n- Hormonal problems\\n- Surgery or injury\\n\\nPsychological causes of ED include:\\n- Anxiety\\n- Depression\\n- Relationship problems\\n\\nSometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner. If this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). If you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical. Erectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medications.",

   "description": "Escherichia coli O157, sometimes called VTEC, is a bacterial infection. It can cause severe stomach pain, bloody diarrhea and kidney failure. E. coli O157 is found in the gut and feces of many animals, particularly cattle. It's an uncommon cause of gastroenteritis but can be caught by:\\n\\n- Eating contaminated food, such as raw leafy vegetables or undercooked meat – always wash all vegetables, including salad leaves, that will be eaten raw, unless they have been pre-prepared and are labelled ‘ready to eat’ (washing may reduce the risk of infection, but will not eliminate any risk of infection completely)\\n- Touching infected animals or accidentally coming into contact with their feces\\n- Contact with people who have the illness, particularly if you do not wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or before handling food\\n- Drinking water from inadequately treated water supplies\\n- Swimming or playing in contaminated water, such as ponds or streams\\n\\nPeople usually notice symptoms 3 to 4 days after they have been infected. But symptoms can start any time between 1 and 14 days afterwards.",

   "description": "A febrile seizure is a fit that can happen when a child has a fever. Febrile seizures are also sometimes called febrile convulsions. They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren't serious. Around one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. They most often occur between the ages of six months and three years. During a febrile seizure, the child's body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. Some children may wet themselves. This is known as a tonic clonic seizure.\\n\\nWhat to do during a seizure\\n\\nIf your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury. Stay with your child and try to make a note of how long the seizure lasts.\\n\\nIf it's your child's first seizure, or it lasts longer than five minutes, take them to the nearest hospital as soon as possible, or call an ambulance. While it's unlikely that there's anything seriously wrong, it's best to be sure. Almost all children make a complete recovery after having a febrile seizure.",
