Most cases are infectious, although gastroenteritis may occur after ingestion of drugs and chemical toxins (eg, metals, plant substances). Acquisition may be foodborne, waterborne, person-to-person spread, or occasionally through zoonotic spread. In the US, an estimated 1 in 6 people contracts foodborne illness each year. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Diagnosis is clinical or by stool culture, although polymerase chain reaction testing and immunoassays are increasingly used. Treatment is symptomatic, although some parasitic and some bacterial infections require specific anti-infective therapy.",

    "description": "Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage. Most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and experience no further problems, but severe cases can have serious complications and can even be fatal. Acute pancreatitis is different to chronic pancreatitis, where the inflammation of the pancreas persists for many years.",

These symptoms usually start soon after being exposed to an allergen. Some people only get allergic rhinitis for a few months at a time because they're sensitive to seasonal allergens, such as tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round. Most people with allergic rhinitis have mild symptoms that can be easily and effectively treated. But for some symptoms can be severe and persistent, causing sleep problems and interfering with everyday life. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time, but this can take many years and it's unlikely that the condition will disappear completely.",

For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam or having a medical test or job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal. However, some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily life. Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including panic disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia). However, the information in this section is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).",

    "description": "Appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix. The appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5-10cm (2-4 inches) long. It's connected to the large intestine, where stools (feces) are formed. Nobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn't harmful. Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go. Within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe. Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. You may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience diarrhea.",

Benign brain tumors are low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly and are less likely to return after treatment. Malignant brain tumors are high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumors) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumors); they're more likely to grow back after treatment",

    "description": "Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it. It's much less common in men than women. The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged. Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge.",

People with ME/CFS experience severe pain and fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise (PEM). This is when the body is not able to recover after using even small amounts of energy. This fatigue feels very different from ordinary tiredness. It might take a day or 2 to kick in after physical, mental, or emotional exertion. ME/CFS affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups. It doesn't go away with sleep or rest and affects everyday life.

It's a common type of urinary tract infection (UTI), particularly in women, and is usually more of a nuisance than a cause for serious concern. Mild cases will often get better by themselves within a few days. However, some people experience episodes of cystitis frequently and may need regular or long-term treatment. There's also a chance that cystitis could lead to a more serious kidney infection in some cases, so it's important to seek professional advice if your symptoms don't improve.",

Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time. While some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it's actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. It impacts people of all genders and ages – including children. Studies show that around 4% of children  between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious. With the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.",

    "description": "Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain and is defined by repeated seizures. Symptoms of epilepsy:\\nThe main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are different types of seizure, depending on which part of the brain it affects. The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.\\n\\nThe severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a \"trance-like\" state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).\\n\\nSome people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.\\n\\nPeople with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms. Seizures can occur when you're awake or asleep. The type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are:\\n\\n1. Focal (or partial) seizures – where only a small part of the brain is affected\\n2. Generalized seizures – where most or all of the brain is affected",

It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 will have it to some degree. See your doctor if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted). Erectile dysfunction can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. Physical causes include:\\n\\n-Narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis – commonly associated with high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol or diabetes\\n- Hormonal problems\\n- Surgery or injury\\n\\nPsychological causes of ED include:\\n- Anxiety\\n- Depression\\n- Relationship problems\\n\\nSometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner. If this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). If you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical. Erectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medications.",

They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren't serious. Around one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. They most often occur between the ages of six months and three years. During a febrile seizure, the child's body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. Some children may wet themselves. This is known as a tonic clonic seizure.\\n\\nWhat to do during a seizure\\n\\nIf your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury. Stay with your child and try to make a note of how long the seizure lasts.\\n\\nIf it's your child's first seizure, or it lasts longer than five minutes, take them to the nearest hospital as soon as possible, or call an ambulance. While it's unlikely that there's anything seriously wrong, it's best to be sure. Almost all children make a complete recovery after having a febrile seizure.",

Globus can be caused by many things, such as an increased tension of muscles or irritation in the throat. There are various things you can do to manage your globus symptoms at home. Signs and symptoms of globus:\\n\\nDifferent people describe it differently. It may be felt as:\\n- Tightness or a pressure in your throat\\n- Secretions (mucus that you are unable to clear)\\n- An area of discomfort in your throat\\n- A feeling of something stuck or a lump in your throat.\\n\\nIf you feel something sticking in your throat, but can eat and drink normally and without pain, you do not need to worry. Many people with globus sensation notice the symptoms most when they are swallowing their saliva, or that it increases with stress and worry. Your symptoms can vary from day to day.",

It's also suggested that some people are more likely to develop fibromyalgia because of genes inherited from their parents. In many cases, the condition appears to be triggered by a physically or emotionally stressful event.",

Flu isn't the same as the common cold. Flu is caused by a different group of viruses and the symptoms tend to start more suddenly, be more severe and last longer. Some of the main symptoms of flu include:\\n- A high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\\n- Tiredness and weakness\\n- Headache\\n- General aches and pains\\n- Cough\\nCold-like symptoms, such as a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat, can also be caused by flu, but they tend to be less severe than the other symptoms you have. Flu can make you feel so exhausted and unwell that you have to stay in bed and rest until you feel better.",

Over 85% of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinoma, which means the cancer started in the gland cells lining the gallbladder. Cancer that starts in the skin-like cells that line the gallbladder is known as squamous cell cancer.\\n\\nThe gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that's located underneath the liver. It's main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats. It passes from the liver through a series of channels (bile ducts) into the gallbladder, where it's stored. Over time, bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. The gallbladder is a useful but not essential organ, which can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.",

    "description": "Gout is a type of arthritis in which small crystals form inside and around the joints. It causes sudden attacks of severe pain and swelling. The condition mainly affects men over 30 and women after the menopause. Overall, gout is more common in men than women. Gout can be extremely painful and debilitating, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further attacks. Signs and symptoms of gout:\\n\\n- Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers.\\n- Severe pain in one or more joints\\n- Joint feeling hot and very tender\\n- Swelling in and around the affected joint\\n- Red, shiny skin over the affected joint\\n\\nSymptoms develop rapidly over a few hours and typically last three to 10 days. After this time the pain should pass and the joint should return to normal. Almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point, usually within a year.",

When to seek medical advice\\n\\nSee your doctor if you have persistent or severe symptoms of hemorrhoids. You should always get any rectal bleeding checked out, so your doctor can rule out more potentially serious causes",

    "description": "Most headaches are not serious. In many cases, you can treat your headache at home. When to get professional advice:\\n\\n- Your headache is getting worse despite taking painkillers\\n- Painful or frequent headaches affect your daily activities or cause you to miss work\\n- Your headache does not go away and gets worse over time\\n- Your headache is triggered suddenly by coughing, laughing, sneezing, changing posture, or physical effort\\n- You have a headache and you feel weak\\n- Slurred speech or memory loss\\n- High temperature, feel hot and shivery, and have a stiff neck or a rash\\n- Vision problems\\n- Severe pain and redness in one of your eyes.\\n\\nTypes of Headaches:\\n\\n1. Tension headaches:\\nTension headaches are the most common type of headache. They're what we think of as normal, 'everyday' headaches. They feel like a constant ache that affects both sides of the head, as though a tight band is stretched around it. Normally, tension headaches are not severe enough to prevent you doing everyday activities. They usually last for 30 minutes to several hours, but can last for several days.\\n\\n2. Migraines are less common than tension headaches. They're usually felt as a severe, throbbing pain at the front or side of the head. Some people also have other symptoms, such as: nausea, vomiting, increased sensitivity to light or sound. Migraines can stop you carrying out your normal daily activities. They usually last at least a couple of hours. Some people find they need to stay in bed for days at a time.\\n\\n3. Cluster headaches:\\nCluster headaches are a rare type of headache. They occur in clusters for a month or two at a time around the same time of year. Cluster headaches are excruciatingly painful. They cause intense pain around one eye, and often occur with other symptoms, such as watering or red eye, blocked or runny nose",

    "condition": "Hiatal hernia",
    "id": 61,
    "description": "A hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (\"hiatal\") in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle between the chest and the abdomen (tummy). A hiatal hernia itself rarely has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).\\nGERD is where stomach acid leaks into the esophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatal hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the esophagus from working properly. Your esophagus can become severely irritated, because it's not protected against stomach acid. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems (dysphagia).\\nThere are 2 main types of hiatal hernia. They are:\\n1. Sliding hiatal hernias – hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatal hernias are of this type)\\n2. Para-esophageal hiatal hernias – also called rolling hiatal hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the esophagus (about 5-15% of hiatal hernias are of this type)\\n\\nThey can usually be diagnosed using an X-ray or an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body.",

The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes. In Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. There are two main types of lymphomas:\\n\\n1. Hodgkin’s Lymphoma\\n2. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma .\\n\\nThe way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy. This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.",

The damage to the brain gets worse over time. It can affect movement, cognition (perception, awareness, thinking, judgement) and mental health. People can start to show the symptoms of Huntington's disease at almost any age. Most will develop problems between the ages of 30 and 50. The condition gradually gets worse over the years. \\n\\nEarly symptoms:\\nBehavioral changes are often the first symptoms of Huntington's disease. These changes often include: a lack of emotions and not recognizing the needs of others, periods of aggression, excitement, depression, antisocial behavior and anger, apathy - causing a person to appear lazy or have a lack of interest in hygiene and self care, difficulty concentrating on more than one task and handling complex situations, irritability and impulsiveness\\n\\nFurther symptoms of Huntington's might include:\\nPsychiatric problems - some people develop obsessive behaviors, delusional thoughts or behaviors, stubbornness, lack of self awareness, or suicidal thoughts, uncontrollable movements of the face, jerking, clicking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body, difficulty eating because the mouth and throat muscles don't work properly which can lead to choking and chest infections, communication problems - difficulty putting thoughts into words and slurring of speech, sexual problems - a loss of interest in sex or making inappropriate sexual demands, balance problems",

When your glucose (sugar) level is too low, your body doesn't have enough energy to carry out its activities. Hypoglycemia is most commonly associated with diabetes, and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard. In rare cases, it's possible for a person who doesn't have diabetes to experience hypoglycemia. It can be triggered by malnutrition, binge drinking or certain conditions, such as Addison's disease.\\n\\nMost people will have some warning that their blood glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall low. Typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycemia can lose consciousness. It's also possible for hypoglycemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking",

The symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time. Symptoms can include:\\n- Shortness of breath\\n- Persistent dry cough\\n- Tiredness\\n- Loss of appetite and weight loss\\n- Rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers)\\n\\nMany people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape.

    "description": "Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It's not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment. Impetigo is the most common skin infection in young children, but it can affect people of all ages. There are two types of impetigo:\\n\\n1. Non-bullous impetigo – the most common type\\nThe symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected. The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin. After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. The sores aren't painful, but they may be itchy. It's important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people. Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.\\nBullous impetigo\\nThe symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1-2cm across. The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring. The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it's important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin. Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.",

    "condition": "Indigestion",
    "id": 67,
    "description": "Indigestion can be pain or discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia) or burning pain behind the breastbone (heartburn). Dyspepsia and heartburn may occur together or on their own. Symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking. Common associated symptoms include:\\n- Feeling full or bloated\\n- Feeling sick (nausea)\\n- Belching\\n- Bringing up (regurgitating) fluid or food into the esophagus\\nIndigestion may be caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful. The majority of people with indigestion don't have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching). In most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress or taking certain medications.",

It's a common problem thought to regularly affect around one in every three people, and is particularly common in elderly people. If you have insomnia, you may:\\n- Find it difficult to fall asleep\\n- Lie awake for long periods at night\\n- Wake up several times during the night\\n- Wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep\\n- Not feel refreshed when you get up\\n- Find it hard to nap during the day, despite feeling tired\\n- Feel tired and irritable during the day and have difficulty concentrating\\nOccasional episodes of insomnia may come and go without causing any serious problems, but for some people it can last for months or even years at a time. Persistent insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life. It can limit what you're able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues.\\n\\nHow much sleep do I need?\\nThere are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different. On average, a \"normal\" amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.",

    "description": "Iron deficiency anemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells. Iron is used to produce red blood cells, which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won't get as much oxygen as they usually would. There are several different types of anemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type. Other types of anemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body. Many people with iron deficiency anemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anemia develops. The most common symptoms include:\\n\\n- Tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)\\n- Shortness of breath\\n- Noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations)\\n- Pale complexion\\n\\nLess common symptoms include:\\n- Headache\\n- Hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus)\\n- Altered sense of taste\\n- Feeling itchy\\n- Sore or abnormally smooth tongue\\n- Hair loss\\n- A desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica)\\n- Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\\n- Painful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth\\n- Spoon-shaped nails",

    "description": "A kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a painful and unpleasant illness caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of your kidneys. It's more serious than cystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful. If treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn't cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn't treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage. Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side.\\n\\nSee your doctor if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. Most kidney infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers.\\n\\nA kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called E. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys.",

    "condition": "Kidney stones",
    "id": 73,
    "description": "Kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 to 60. They're quite common, with around three in 20 men and up to two in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives. The medical term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if they cause severe pain it's known as renal colic.\\n\\nSmall kidney stones may go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine. But it's fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the:\\n* Ureter – the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder\\n* Urethra – the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body\\n* A blockage can cause severe pain in the abdomen or groin and sometimes causes a urinary tract infection (UTI).\\n\\nThe waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump. This is more likely to happen if you don't drink enough fluids, if you're taking some types of medication, or if you have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine.\\n\\nAfter a kidney stone has formed, your body will try to pass it out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder).",

    "description": "Laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx (voice box). In most cases, it gets better without treatment in about a week. Symptoms of laryngitis can begin suddenly and usually get worse over a period of two to three days. Common symptoms of laryngitis include:\\n\\n- Hoarseness\\n- Difficulty speaking\\n- Sore throat\\n- Mild fever\\n- Irritating cough\\n- A constant need to clear your throat\\n\\nThe hoarse voice and speaking difficulties usually get worse each day you're ill and may last for up to a week after the other symptoms have gone. In a few cases, the larynx can swell and cause breathing difficulties. This isn't common in adults but can occur in young children who have smaller, narrower windpipes. Laryngitis is often linked to another illness, such as a cold, flu, throat infection (pharyngitis) or tonsillitis, so you might also have other symptoms such as:\\n\\n- A headache\\n- Swollen glands\\n- Runny nose\\n- Pain when swallowing\\n- Feeling tired and achy",

It usually occurs in the calf muscles, although it can affect any part of your leg, including your feet and thighs. After the cramping has passed, you may have pain and tenderness in your leg for several hours. Three out of four cases occur at night during sleep.\\n\\nLeg cramps can occur for no apparent reason, known as idiopathic leg cramps, or as a symptom or complication of a health condition, known as secondary leg cramps. Causes of secondary leg cramps can include:\\n\\n- Pregnancy\\n- Exercise\\n- Certain types of medication, such as statins (medicines that help lower cholesterol levels)\\n- Liver disease\\n\\nDuring a cramp, your muscles suddenly contract (shorten), causing pain in your leg. This is known as a spasm, and you cannot control the affected muscle. The cramp can last from a few seconds to 10 minutes. When the spasm passes, you will be able to control the affected muscle again.",

It works hard, performing hundreds of complex functions, including:\\n\\n- Fighting infections and illness\\n- Removing toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, from the body\\n- Controlling cholesterol levels\\n- Helping blood to clot (thicken)\\n- Releasing bile, a liquid that breaks down fats and aids digestion\\n\\nLiver disease doesn't usually cause any obvious signs or symptoms until it's fairly advanced and the liver is damaged. At this stage, possible symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss and jaundice. Types of liver disease:\\n\\n- Alcohol-related liver disease – where the liver is damaged after years of alcohol misuse, this can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver)\\n- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease – a build-up of fat within liver cells, usually seen in overweight people or those who are obese\\n- Hepatitis – which is inflammation (swelling) of the liver caused by a viral infection or exposure to harmful substances such as alcohol\\n- Hemochromatosis – an inherited disorder where there's a gradual build-up of iron in the body, usually around the liver\\n- Primary biliary cirrhosis – a rare, long-term type of liver disease that damages the bile ducts in the liver\\n\\nAll types of liver disease can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), not just alcohol-related liver disease. Three of the main causes of liver disease are:\\n- Obesity\\n- Undiagnosed hepatitis infection\\n- Alcohol misuse\\n\\nThese causes of liver disease are all preventable.",

Cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. There are 2 main types of primary lung cancer. These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts. They are:\\n\\n1. Non-small-cell lung cancer – the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases; can be either squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma\\n2. mall-cell lung cancer – a less common type that usually spreads faster than non-small-cell lung cancer\\n\\nThe type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended. \\n\\nLung cancer mainly affects older people. It's rare in people younger than 40, and the rates of lung cancer rise sharply with age. Lung cancer is most commonly diagnosed in people aged 70 to 74. Although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the main cause (accounting for over 85% of cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances.",

    "description": "Lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. There are some types of lupus that just affect the skin – such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects. However, the term \"lupus\" is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs.\\n\\nSymptoms range from mild to severe, and many people will have long periods with few or no symptoms before experiencing a sudden flare-up, where their symptoms are particularly severe. Even mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person’s quality of life. SLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are:\\n\\n- Fatigue (extreme tiredness)\\n- Rashes – particularly on the face, wrists and hands\\n- Joint pain and swelling\\n\\nAs the symptoms of SLE can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose.\\n\\nWhat causes lupus?\\nSLE is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs. As with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in certain people.",

Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and moorland areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Lyme disease is usually easier to treat the earlier it's diagnosed. Many people with early symptoms of Lyme disease develop a circular rash around the tick bite. The rash:\\n\\n- Usually develops around 3 to 30 days after you've been bitten\\n- Often described as looking like a bull's-eye on a dart board\\n- Red and the edges may feel slightly raised\\n- May get bigger over several days or weeks\\n- Typically around 15 cm (6 inches) across, but it can be much larger or smaller\\n\\nSome people may develop several rashes in different parts of their body. Around 1 in 3 people with Lyme disease won't develop a rash. Other symptoms of Lyme disease:\\n- Tiredness (fatigue)\\n- Muscle pain\\n- Joint pain\\n- Headaches\\n- High temperature (fever)\\n- Chills\\n- Neck stiffness",

Other symptoms of lymphedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them. Lymphedema can get worse if it's not treated, so you should speak to a doctor if you think you may have the condition.\\n\\nLymphedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. This is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. Its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues. Abnormal development of the lymphatic system, damage to it, and/or an increase in fluid in the body tissues can all lead to lymphedema. There are two main types of lymphoedema:\\n\\n- Primary lymphedema – caused by faulty genes affecting the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually occurs in early adulthood\\n- Secondary lymphedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system, often due to an infection, injury, cancer treatment, inflammation of the limb or a lack of limb movement",

    "description": "Measles is an infection that spreads very easily. It's unpleasant and can sometimes have serious complications. Having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to prevent it. Anyone can get measles if they haven't been vaccinated or they haven't had it before. It's most common in young children. Measles usually clears in around 7 to 10 days. The first symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected. These can include:\\n\\n- Cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough\\n- Sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light\\n- Watery eyes\\n- Swollen eyes\\n- High temperature (fever), which may reach around 40°C (104°F)\\n- Small greyish-white spots in the mouth\\n- Aches and pains\\n- Loss of appetite\\n- Tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy\\n\\nThe measles rash appears around 2 to 4 days after the initial symptoms and normally fades after about a week. The rash:\\n\\n- Is made up of small red-brown, flat or slightly raised spots that may join together into larger blotchy patches\\n- Usually first appears on the head or neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body\\n- Is slightly itchy for some people\\n- Red spotty rash\\n\\nIs measles serious?\\nMeasles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It's highly unlikely you'll get it again. However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).",

Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include:\\n\\n- High temperature (fever) over 37.5C (99.5F) being sick\\n- Headache\\n- Blotchy rash that doesn't fade when a glass is rolled over it (this won't always develop)\\n- Stiff neck\\n- Dislike of bright lights\\n- Drowsiness or unresponsiveness\\n- Seizures (fits)\\n\\nThese symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear. You should get medical advice as soon as possible if you're concerned that you or your child could have meningitis.\\n\\nMeningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial meningitis is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis. Infections that cause meningitis can be spread through:\\n\\n- Sneezing\\n- Coughing\\n- Kissing\\n- Sharing utensils, cutlery and toothbrushes\\n\\nMeningitis is usually caught from people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat but aren't ill themselves.",

    "description": "Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of MND. MND happens when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, called motor neurons, stop working properly and die prematurely. This is known as neurodegeneration. Motor neurons control muscle activity like:\\n\\n- Gripping\\n- Walking\\n- Speaking\\n- Swallowing\\n- Breathing\\n\\nAs MND progresses, it can become more difficult to do some or all of these activities. The symptoms of MND start gradually over weeks and months. They tend to appear on one side of the body first and get progressively worse.\\n\\nEarly symptoms\\n\\nSometimes the early symptoms are mistaken for similar conditions that also affect the nervous system.\\n\\nAs MND becomes more advanced, more parts and functions of the body are affected. This can make you more likely to experience infections, like chest infections, which can cause your condition to get worse quicker.\\n\\n- Muscular symptoms\\n- Speaking and swallowing difficulties\\n- Saliva problems\\n- Excessive yawning\\n- Emotional changes\\n- Changes to mental abilities\\n- Breathing difficulties\\n\\nAs MND progresses to its final phase, you might experience:\\n\\n- Increasing body paralysis, which means you'll need help with most daily activities\\n- Significant shortness of breath\\n\\nEventually, non-invasive breathing assistance won't be enough to make up for the loss of normal lung function. At this stage, more medication can help to reduce symptoms of breathlessness and anxiety related to it.",

Multiple myeloma affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow. Myeloma does not usually take the form of a lump or tumor. Instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells. Myeloma often affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. Commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs.\\n\\nIn the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It's often only suspected or diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test. However, myeloma will eventually cause a wide range of problems, including:\\n\\n- A persistent dull ache or specific areas of tenderness in your bones\\n -Weak bones that break (fracture) easily\\n- Tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath (caused by anemia)\\n- Repeated infections\\n- Less commonly, bruising and unusual bleeding – such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods\\n\\nSpeak to your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to get a proper diagnosis.",

    "description": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that affects the brain and/or spinal cord. It can cause symptoms like problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance. It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability. In many cases, it’s possible to treat symptoms. It's often diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. It's about two to three times more common in women than men. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a wide range of symptoms and can affect any part of the body. It affects everyone differently. The symptoms are unpredictable. Some people's symptoms develop and worsen over time, while for others, they come and go. Periods when symptoms get worse are known as relapses. Periods when symptoms improve or disappear are known as remissions. Some of the most common symptoms include:\\n\\n- Muscle spasms, stiffness and weakness\\n- Vision problems\\n- Abnormal sensations\\n- Mobility problems\\n- Pain\\n- Bladder problems\\n- Bowel problems\\n- Sexual problems\\n- Speech and swallowing difficulties\\n- Fatigue\\n- Mental health issues\\n- Problems with thinking, learning and planning\\n\\nWhat happens when someone has MS? MS is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it. In the case of MS, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. This is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body. The attacks cause the myelin sheath to become inflamed in small patches (plaques or lesions). This can be seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. These patches of inflammation can disrupt the messages travelling along the nerves. It can slow them down, jumble them, send them the wrong way, or stop them from getting through completely. This disruption leads to the symptoms and signs of MS.\\n\\nWhen the inflammation goes away, it can leave behind scarring of the myelin sheath (sclerosis). These attacks, particularly if frequent and repeated, can lead to permanent damage.",

Mumps usually clears within 1 or 2 weeks. Symptoms of mumps\\n\\n- The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after you're infected. Mumps causes painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands). It gives a distinctive 'hamster face' appearance. Other symptoms of mumps can include:\\n\\n- Headaches\\n- Joint pain\\n- Feeling sick\\n- Dry mouth\\n- Mild stomach (abdominal) pain\\n- Feeling tired\\n- Loss of appetite\\n- High temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F), or above\\n\\nThese may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands. Sometimes, mumps doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms. Most cases of mumps occur in people aged between 17 and 34 who have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Once you've had mumps, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It's highly unlikely you'll get it again.\\n\\nIf you have mumps:\\n- Stay off school or work for at least 5 days after your symptoms first develop\\n- Regularly wash your hands with soap\\n- Use and dispose of tissues when you sneeze\\n- Avoid close contact with anyone who isn't fully vaccinated",

People with Ménière's disease usually experience some or all of these symptoms during sudden attacks, which typically last around two to three hours, although it can take a day or two for the symptoms to disappear completely. It's worth noting, however, that the symptoms and severity of Ménière's disease vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience frequent attacks of vertigo along with hearing loss, while others may have severe tinnitus with minor vertigo. Other symptoms include sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis) or distorted sound.\\n\\nMénière's disease often progresses through different stages. In the early stages, most people have sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness. The attacks of vertigo continue, but may come and go and become less severe. It's common to experience a loss of balance or dizziness before or after these attacks. Permanent hearing loss and tinnitus continue to develop and may be worse during attacks of vertigo.\\n\\nDuring the later stages, the episodes of vertigo tend to occur less frequently and sometimes stop altogether over time. However, the tinnitus and hearing loss often become worse and you may be left with permanent balance and hearing problems.",

It usually affects the eyes first and may spread to other parts of the body. It can take weeks, months or years for symptoms to develop in other parts of the body. The severity of the symptoms is different for each person. It's likely that your symptoms will tend to get worse when you're tired. The symptoms might improve after resting. Symptoms can include:\\n\\n- Eyes\\n- Swallowing, speaking and breathing problems\\n- Limbs and neck weakness \\n- Double vision\\n\\nIt can be difficult to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. You might need several tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms before you can be diagnosed with myasthenia gravis.",

It's often difficult to recognize nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions. Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don't have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage. Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include:\\n\\n- A lump in the neck\\n- Hearing loss – usually only in 1 ear\\n- Tinnitus – hearing sounds that come from inside the body rather than from an outside source\\n- A blocked or stuffy nose\\n- Nosebleeds\\n\\nSpeak to your doctor if you develop any worrying symptoms, particularly if they don't improve after a few weeks. While they're very unlikely to be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, it's best to get them checked out. About 3 times as many men as women are affected by nasopharyngeal cancer.

    "condition": "Neuroblastoma: Children",
    "id": 97,
    "description": "Most children who have neuroblastoma are younger than 5 years old. It's the most common solid tumor in children that occurs outside of the brain and makes up 8% of the total number of children’s cancers. More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. It's devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organizations to help you through this difficult time. Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it's important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation. Neuroblastoma develops from the cells left behind from a baby’s development in the womb. The cells that it develops from are called neuroblasts.\\n\\n‘Neuro’ means nerve, ‘Blast’ means cells in early development ‘Oma’ means a group of cells, or a tumor.\\n\\nNeuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body. The site of origin is either in 1 of the 2 adrenal glands situated in the abdomen (tummy) or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The adrenal glands are specialized glands that are found above the right and left kidney. The adrenal glands normally release hormones to maintain blood pressure, and enable us to respond to stress. In some cases, neuroblastoma can spread to tissues beyond the original site such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver, and skin. The symptoms vary, depending on where your child’s neuroblastoma tumor is:\\n\\n- If the tumor is in the abdomen, your child’s tummy may be swollen and they may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine (peeing)\\n- if the tumor affects the chest area, your child may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing\\n- If the tumor occurs in the neck, it’s often visible as a lump and occasionally affects breathing and swallowing\\n- Occasionally, there are deposits of neuroblastoma in the skin that appear as small, blue-colored lumps\\n- If the tumor is pressing on the spinal cord, children may have weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily – if your child is not yet walking, you may notice reduced leg movements; they may also have constipation or difficulty passing urine (peeing)\\n- Your child may be found to have high blood pressure\\n- Very rarely, children may have jerky eye and muscle movements, and general unsteadiness associated with the neuroblastoma\\n- There are often symptoms of tiredness, being pale, loss of appetite, weight loss, bone pain and generalized discomfort.",

    "id": 98,
    "description": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It's usually seen in people who are overweight or obese. A healthy liver should contain little or no fat. It's estimated that up to 1 in every 3 people in the UK has early stages of NAFLD where there are small amounts of fat in their liver. Early-stage NAFLD doesn't usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including cirrhosis, if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of problems such as diabetes, heart attacks and strokes. If detected and managed at an early stage, it's possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver. NAFLD develops in 4 main stages. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realizing it. In small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed. The main stages of NAFLD are:\\n\\n1. Simple fatty liver (steatosis) – a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason\\n2. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)– a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population\\n3. Fibrosis – where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby blood vessels, but the liver is still able to function normally\\n4. Cirrhosis – the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and liver cancer\\n\\nIt can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse. You're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you:\\n\\n- Are obese or overweight – particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an 'apple-like' body shape)\\n- Have type 2 diabetes\\n- Have high blood pressure\\n- Have high cholesterol\\n- Are over the age of 50\\n- Smoke\\n\\nHowever, NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children. There aren't usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won't know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.",

It's also called the 'winter vomiting bug' because it's more common in winter, although you can catch it at any time of the year. Norovirus can be very unpleasant but usually clears up by itself in a few days. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home. Speak to your doctor:\\n\\n- Your baby or child has passed 6 or more watery stools (poo) in the past 24 hours or has vomited 3 times or more in the past 24 hours\\n- Your baby or child is less responsive, feverish, or has pale or mottled skin\\n- You or your child has symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or reduced consciousness – babies and elderly people have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated\\n- You have bloody diarrhea\\n- Your symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days\\n- You or your child have a serious underlying medical condition, such as kidney disease, and have diarrhea and vomiting. You're likely to have norovirus if you experience:\\n\\n- Suddenly feeling sick\\n- Projectile vomiting\\n- Watery diarrhea\\n- Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs.\\n\\nThe symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to two or three days.\\n\\nNorovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. You can catch it if small particles of vomit or stools (poo) from an infected person get into your mouth through:\\n\\n- Close contact with someone with norovirus who may breathe out small particles of the virus that you then inhale\\n- Touching contaminated surfaces or objects, as the virus can survive outside the body for several days\\n- Eating contaminated food, which can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before preparing or handling food\\n\\nNorovirus is most infectious from the start of symptoms until 48 hours after all symptoms have stopped. You may also be infectious for a short time before and after this.",

What to do to stop a nosebleed:\\n\\n- Sit down at a table, lean forward and firmly pinch the soft part of your nose, just above your nostrils, for at least 10 to 15 minutes\\n- Lean forward and breathe through your mouth – spit out any blood that collects in your throat or mouth into a bowl; do not swallow any blood\\n- Place an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables covered by a towel on your forehead or back of your neck\\n- Stay upright or seated, rather than lying down, as this reduces the blood pressure in the blood vessels of your nose and will help reduce further bleeding\\n\\nIf the bleeding eventually stops, you won't usually need to seek medical advice.

    "condition": "Obstructive sleep apnoea",
    "id": 101,
    "description": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a relatively common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing. This may lead to regularly interrupted sleep, which can have a big impact on quality of life and increases the risk of developing certain conditions. There are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of OSA:\\n\\n- Apnea – where the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a total blockage of the airway; it's called an apnea when the airflow is blocked for 10 seconds or more\\n- Hypopnea – a partial blockage of the airway that results in an airflow reduction of greater than 50% for 10 seconds or more\\n\\nPeople with OSA may experience repeated episodes of apnea and hypopnea throughout the night. These events may occur around once every one or two minutes in severe cases. The symptoms of OSA are often first spotted by a partner, friend or family member who notices problems while you sleep. Signs of OSA in someone sleeping can include:\\n\\n-Loud snoring\\n- Noisy and labored breathing\\n- Repeated short periods where breathing is interrupted by gasping or snorting\\n- Some people with OSA may also experience night sweats and may wake up frequently during the night to urinate.\\n\\nThese repeated sleep interruptions can make you feel very tired during the day, headaches, fatigue, low energy, and excessive sleepiness. You'll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you may be unaware you have a problem.",

It mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s and is more common in men than women. Esophageal cancer doesn't usually cause any symptoms in the early stages when the tumor is small. It's only when it gets bigger that symptoms tend to develop. Symptoms of esophageal cancer can include:\\n\\n- Difficulty swallowing\\n- Persistent indigestion or heartburn\\n- Bringing up food soon after eating\\n- Loss of appetite and weight loss\\n- Pain or discomfort in your upper tummy, chest or back.\\n\\nSpeak to your GP if you experience:\\n- Swallowing difficulties\\n- Heartburn on most days for three weeks or more\\n- Any other unusual or persistent symptoms\\n\\nThe symptoms can be caused by several conditions and in many cases won't be caused by cancer – but it's a good idea to get them checked out. The exact cause of esophageal cancer is unknown, but the following things can increase your risk:\\n\\n- Persistent gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)\\n- Smoking\\n- Drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time\\n- Being overweight or obese\\n- Having an unhealthy diet that's low in fruit and vegetables\\n\\nStopping smoking, cutting down on alcohol, losing weight and having a healthy diet may help reduce your risk of developing esophageal cancer.",

    "description": "Otitis externa is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the external ear canal, which is the tube between the outer ear and eardrum. Otitis externa is often referred to as \"swimmer's ear\" because repeated exposure to water can make the ear canal more vulnerable to inflammation. Symptoms of otitis externa include:\\n\\n- Ear pain, which can be severe\\n- Itchiness in the ear canal\\n- Discharge of liquid or pus from the ear\\n- Some degree of temporary hearing loss. Usually only one ear is affected.\\n\\nWith treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days. However, some cases can persist for several months or longer. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly use any items that are inserted into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. They may also examine inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope. If you have recurring episodes of otitis externa that haven't responded to treatment, your doctor may take a swab of the inside of your ear. This will be tested to help determine what type of infection you have, if any, so appropriate medication can be prescribed.\\n\\nMost cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection, although the condition can also be caused by:\\n\\n- Irritation\\n- Fungal infections\\n- Allergies\\n\\n)titis externa is relatively common. It's estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives. The condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults 45 to 75 years of age.",

    "id": 106,
    "description": "Overactive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body. Excess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body’s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as:\\n\\n- Nervousness and anxiety\\n- Hyperactivity – where a person can’t stay still and is full of nervous energy\\n- Unexplained or unplanned weight loss\\n- Swelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a goiter, to form in the throat\\n\\nThe severity, frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person. The thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body's growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine. They affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going. \\n\\nIn hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body's metabolism. There are several possible underlying causes, the most common being Graves' disease, in which the body's immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones.",

    "condition": "Pancreatic cancer",
    "id": 107,
    "description": "Pancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas – a large gland that's part of the digestive system. Around half of all new cases are diagnosed in people aged 75 or over. It's uncommon in people under 40 years of age. In the early stages, a tumor in the pancreas doesn't usually cause any symptoms, which can make it difficult to diagnose. It's important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren't usually the result of cancer. But you should contact your GP if you're concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly. The first noticeable symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often:\\n\\n- Pain in the back or stomach area – which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you've eaten\\n- Unexpected weight loss\\n- Jaundice – the most obvious sign is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes; it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (feces) to be pale-colored\\n\\nOther possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:\\n\\n- Nausea and vomiting\\n- Bowel changes\\n- Fever and shivering\\n- Indigestion\\n- Blood clots\\n\\nYou may also develop symptoms of diabetes if you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.\\n\\nIt's not fully understood what causes pancreatic cancer, but a number of risk factors for developing the condition have been identified. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include:\\n\\n- Age – it mainly affects people who are 50 to 80 years of age\\n- Smoking – around 1 in 3 cases is associated with using cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco\\n- Having a history of certain health conditions – such as diabetes, chronic pancreatitis (long-term inflammation of the pancreas), stomach ulcer and Helicobacter pylori infection (a stomach infection)",

    "condition": "Heart Attack",
    "id": 108,
    "description": "A myocardial infarction (commonly called a heart attack) is an extremely dangerous condition that happens because of a lack of blood flow to your heart muscle. The lack of blood flow can occur because of many different factors but is usually related to a blockage in one or more of your heart’s arteries. Without blood flow, the affected heart muscle will begin to die. If blood flow isn’t restored quickly, a heart attack can cause permanent heart damage and death./n/nA heart attack is a life-threatening emergency. If you suspect you or someone you’re with is having a heart attack, call your local emergency services phone number. Time is critical in treating a heart attack, and a delay of even a few minutes can result in permanent heart damage or death.\\n\\nWhat does a heart attack feel like?\\n\\nWhen a heart attack happens, blood flow to a part of your heart stops or is far below normal, which causes injury or death to that part of your heart muscle. When a part of your heart can’t pump because it’s dying from lack of blood flow, it can disrupt the pumping sequence for your entire heart. That reduces or even stops blood flow to the rest of your body, which can be deadly if it isn’t corrected quickly. Symptoms of a heart attack that people describe most often include:\\n\\n- -Chest pain (angina). This can be mild and feel like discomfort or heaviness, or it can be severe and feel like crushing pain. It may start in your chest and spread (or radiate) to other areas like your left arm (or both arms), shoulder, neck, jaw, back or down toward your waist.\\n- Shortness of breath or trouble breathing.\\n- Fatigue.\\n- Trouble sleeping (insomnia).\\n- Nausea or stomach discomfort. Heart attacks can often be mistaken for indigestion or heartburn.\\n- Heart palpitations.\\n- Anxiety or a feeling of “impending doom.”\\n- Sweating.\\n- Feeling lightheaded, dizzy or passing out.",

    "condition": "Pelvic inflammatory disease",
    "id": 110,
    "description": "Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female upper genital tract, including the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries. Most cases of PID are caused by an infection in the vagina or the neck of the womb (cervix) that has spread higher up. Many different types of bacteria can cause PID. However most cases are the result of a chlamydia or gonorrhea infection. In some cases, the cause of the infection that leads to PID is unknown. Such cases may be the result of normally harmless bacteria found in the vagina. These bacteria can sometimes get past the cervix and into the reproductive organs.\\n\\nThe symptoms of PID are fairly general, which means it can be difficult to diagnose. The symptoms may include:\\n\\n- Pain around the pelvis or lower abdomen\\n- Discomfort or pain during sex that is felt deep inside the pelvis\\n- Bleeding between periods or after sex\\n- Unusual vaginal discharge\\n- Fever and vomiting\\n- Pain in the rectum (back passage)\\n\\nIf diagnosed and treated early, the complications of PID can be prevented. If treatment is delayed some of the complications are:\\n\\n- Pelvic abscess formation\\n- Long term or recurrent pelvic pain\\n- Reduced fertility or infertility – this affects 1 in 10 women with PID and is more likely in severe infection or repeated episodes\\n- Ectopic pregnancy – a serious condition where the baby grows outside the womb, most commonly the fallopian tube",

Sometimes the pain is also felt in the shoulder. The pain may be worse when you cough, sneeze or move around, and it may be relieved by taking shallow breaths. Other symptoms can include shortness of breath and a dry cough.\\n\\nVisit your doctor if you experience the above symptoms. Seek immediate medical help if your chest pain is severe, particularly if you also have other symptoms, such as coughing up blood, nausea or sweating.\\n\\Further tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause of your pleurisy and to assess how severe it is. These can include:\\n\\n- Blood tests to determine whether you have an infection or an autoimmune condition\\n- Chest X-rays\\n- An ultrasound scan\\n- Computerized tomography (CT) scan\\n- A biopsy – a small sample of pleural or lung tissue is removed for further testing\\n\\nMost cases are the result of a viral infection (such as the flu) or a bacterial infection (such as pneumonia). In rarer cases, pleurisy can be caused by conditions such as a blood clot blocking the flow of blood into the lungs (pulmonary embolism) or lung cancer.\\n\\nPleurisy can affect people of all ages, but people of 65 years and over are most at risk, because they're more likely to develop a chest infection.",

At the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs are clusters of tiny air sacs. If you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid. The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days. Common symptoms of pneumonia include:\\n\\n- A cough – which may be dry, or produce thick yellow, green, brown or blood-stained mucus (phlegm)\\n- Difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow, and you may feel breathless, even when resting\\n- Rapid heartbeat\\n- Fever\\n- Feeling generally unwell\\n- Sweating and shivering\\n- Loss of appetite\\n- Chest pain – which gets worse when breathing or coughing\\n\\nLess common symptoms include:\\n\\n- Coughing up blood (hemoptysis)\\n- Headaches\\n- Fatigue\\n- Nausea or vomiting\\n- Wheezing\\n- Joint and muscle pain\\n- Feeling confused and disorientated, particularly in elderly people\\n\\nSeek urgent medical attention if you're experiencing severe symptoms, such as rapid breathing, chest pain or confusion.\\n\\nPneumonia can affect people of any age, but it's more common – and can be more serious – in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly. Pneumonia is usually the result of a pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Many different types of bacteria, including Hemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi.\\n\\n- Viral pneumonia – most commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and sometimes influenza type A or B; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children\\n- Aspiration pneumonia – caused by breathing in vomit, a foreign object, such as a peanut, or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical\\n- Fungal pneumonia – rare in the UK and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system\\n- Hospital-acquired pneumonia – pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia",

The main symptom is muscle stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes. It may also cause other symptoms, including:\\n\\n- High temperature (fever) and sweating\\n- Extreme tiredness (fatigue)\\n- Loss of appetite\\n- Weight loss\\n- Depression\\n\\nIf you have pain and stiffness that lasts longer than a week, you should see your doctor so the cause can be investigated.\\n\\nDiagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica can be difficult because the symptoms are similar to those of many other conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis. These conditions will need to be ruled out before polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosed. The cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be responsible. Polymyalgia rheumatica is age-related. Most people who are diagnosed with the condition are over 70. It's extremely rare in people younger than 50. It's also more common in women than men.",

Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt. They may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult. These symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person’s day-to-day life. The type of events that can cause PTSD include:\\n\\n- Serious road accidents\\n- Violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery\\n- Prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect\\n- Witnessing violent deaths\\n- Military combat\\n- Being held hostage\\n- Natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis\\n\\nPTSD can develop immediately after someone experiences a disturbing event or it can occur weeks, months or even years later. PTSD is estimated to affect about 1 in every 3 people who have a traumatic experience, but it's not clear exactly why some people develop the condition and others don't.\\n\\nIt's normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but most people improve naturally over a few weeks. You should visit your doctor if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome. If necessary, your doctor might refer you to mental health specialists for further assessment and treatment",

    "id": 117,
    "description": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have it for many years. Symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis). When this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied. These symptoms shouldn’t be ignored, but they do not mean you definitely have prostate cancer. It is more likely that they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or prostate enlargement).\\n\\nThe prostate is a small gland in the pelvis. About the size of a satsuma, it's located between the penis and the bladder and surrounds the urethra. The main function of the prostate is to help in the production of semen. It produces a thick white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen. The causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. However, certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition. The chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. Most cases develop in men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or older.\\n\\nThere is no single test for prostate cancer. All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you. The most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are blood tests, a physical examination of your prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE) and a biopsy. The blood test, known as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, measures the level of PSA and may help detect early prostate cancer.",

    "description": "Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore. Psoriasis affects around 2% of population. It can start at any age, but most often develops in adults under 35 years old. The condition affects men and women equally. The severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some people it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have a major impact on their quality of life.\\n\\nPsoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe.\\n\\n- Red, raised and dry skin in oval shape\\n- Psoriasis causes areas of red, flaky and crusty skin.\\n\\nPeople with psoriasis have an increased production of skin cells. Skin cells are normally made and replaced every 3 to 4 weeks, but in psoriasis this process only lasts about 3 to 7 days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis. Although the process isn't fully understood, it's thought to be related to a problem with the immune system. The immune system is your body's defense against disease and infection, but for people with psoriasis, it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake.\\n\\nIf your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in arthritis). You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken.",

    "condition": "Psoriatic arthritis",
    "id": 119,
    "description": "Psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that develops in some people with the skin condition psoriasis. It typically causes affected joints to become inflamed (swollen), stiff and painful. Between 20-40% of people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Psoriasis affecting the skin affects around 3% of people. In most cases, people will experience problems with their skin before they notice any symptoms affecting their joints. In a minority of cases, skin problems may develop after or at the same time as joint problems.\\n\\nLike psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is thought to be a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. It's not clear why some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis and others don't.\\n\\nThe pain, swelling and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the condition often affects particular areas including the\\n\\n- Hands\\n- Feet\\n- Knees\\n- Elbows\\n- Neck and spine\\n- Tendons can also be involved – in some people they may be the major problem.\\n\\nSymptoms usually develop slowly meaning that many people are unaware that they are developing psoriatic arthritis. In rarer cases, symptoms can develop suddenly and without warning. The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person. Some people may have severe problems affecting many joints, whereas others may only notice mild symptoms in one or two joints. There may be times when your symptoms improve and periods when they get worse (known as flare-ups or relapses). Some people may reach a point where they have no symptoms at all (known as remission). Relapses can be very difficult to predict, but can often be managed with medication when they happen.\\n\\nIf your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment. A rheumatologist will usually be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis if you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, and other types of arthritis – such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis – have been ruled out. A number of tests may be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis, including blood tests to check for signs of inflammation in your body and the presence of certain antibodies found in other types of arthritis, as well as X-rays or scans of your joints.",

It's often referred to as Raynaud’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease or just Raynaud's. Raynaud’s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. The condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood. This causes the affected area to change color to white, then blue and then red, as the blood flow returns. You may also experience numbness, pain, and pins and needles. Symptoms of Raynaud's can last from a few minutes to several hours. It's not a serious threat to your health, but can be painful and difficult to live with. If can affect your ability to move your fingers and hands. People with Raynaud’s often go for long periods without any symptoms, and sometimes the condition goes away altogether. Other parts of the body that can be affected by Raynaud’s include the ears, nose, nipples and lips.\\n\\nThere are two types of Raynaud's:\\n\\n- Primary – when the condition develops by itself (this is the most common type)\\n- Secondary – when it's caused by another health condition\\n\\nMost cases of secondary Raynaud’s are associated with conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue (autoimmune conditions), such as scleroderma and lupus. The causes of primary Raynaud’s are unclear. However 1 in 10 people with primary Raynaud’s goes on to develop a condition associated with secondary Raynaud’s, such as lupus.\\n\\nSecondary Raynaud’s can severely restrict the blood supply, so it carries a higher risk of complications, such as ulcers, scarring and even tissue death (gangrene) in the most serious cases. However, severe complications are rare.",

    "description": "Reactive arthritis, formerly known as Reiter's syndrome, is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) in various places in the body. It usually develops following an infection, and in most cases clears up in a few months without causing long-term problems. The three most common places affected by reactive arthritis are:\\n\\n- The joints (arthritis), which can cause pain, stiffness and swelling\\n- The eyes (conjunctivitis), which can cause eye pain and redness\\n- The urethra (non-gonococcal urethritis), which can cause pain when urinating (the urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body) \\n\\nHowever, most people will not experience all of these problems. Reactive arthritis usually develops within four weeks of an infection, typically after a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel. For reasons that are still unclear, the immune system (the body's defense against infection) appears to malfunction in response to the infection and starts attacking healthy tissue, causing it to become inflamed.\\n\\nSee your doctor if you have swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had symptoms of an infection such as diarrhea or pain when passing urine. There is no single test for reactive arthritis, although blood and urine tests, genital swabs and X-rays may be used to check for infection and rule out other causes of your symptoms. Your doctor will also want to know about your recent medical history, such as whether you may have recently had a bowel infection or an STI.\\n\\nThere is currently no cure for reactive arthritis, but most people get better in around six months. Meanwhile, treatment can help to relieve symptoms such as pain and stiffness. Symptoms can often be controlled using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and painkillers such as ibuprofen. Severe symptoms may require more powerful steroid medication (corticosteroids) or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).\\n\\nReactive arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects young adults aged 20-40. Men are generally affected more than woman – particularly in cases linked to STIs, which are estimated to be about 10 times more common in men.",

Treatment is very effective and nearly all children with retinoblastoma are cured. More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. It's devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organizations to help you through this difficult time. Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it's important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\\n\\nRetinoblastoma develops in the light-sensitive lining of the eye (called the retina). There are 2 forms of retinoblastoma:\\n\\n- A heritable form – this is genetic or inherited; there are often tumors in both eyes (bilateral) or sometimes only in 1 eye\\n- A non-heritable form – this is not passed on in the family; there’s 1 tumor in only 1 eye (unilateral)\\n\\nThe heritable form of retinoblastoma, which accounts for about 2 in every 5 cases, is caused by a genetic abnormality. This means that an abnormal gene allows the tumor to develop. This abnormal gene may either be inherited from a parent or happen for the first time at an early stage of development in the womb.\\n\\nSome children with a family history of retinoblastoma are picked up by screening before they have any symptoms. If there’s no family history of retinoblastoma, the first sign of the condition is often a white pupil that does not reflect light (leukocoria). This may be picked up when a picture of your child is taken using flash photography. The pupil of the affected eye may look white in the photograph. Some children may have a squint or, if the tumor is large, they may have a painful red eye.",

    "description": "Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma (tumor). Most children with rhabdomyosarcoma are younger than 10 years old. It's more common in boys than girls. More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. It's devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organizations to help you through this difficult time. Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\\n\\nSarcomas are rare types of tumor that develop in the supporting tissues of the body, such as bone, muscle or cartilage. There are 2 main types of sarcomas:\\n- Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels, or in any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body\\n- Bone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton\\n\\nRhabdomyosarcoma is the most common of soft tissue sarcomas in children. These tumors develop from muscle or fibrous tissue and can grow in any part of the body. The most common areas of the body to be affected are around the head and neck, bladder, testes, womb, or vagina. Sometimes tumors are also found in a muscle or a limb, in the chest or in the abdominal wall. If the tumor is in the head or neck area, it can occasionally spread into the brain or the fluid around the spinal cord. \\n\\nThe most common symptom is a lump or swelling. Other symptoms will depend on the part of the body that’s affected by the rhabdomyosarcoma:\\n- A tumor in the head or neck area can sometimes cause a blockage (obstruction) and discharge from the nose or throat; occasionally, an eye may appear swollen and protruding\\n- Tumor in the abdomen (tummy) can cause pain or discomfort in the abdomen and difficulty going to the toilet (constipation)\\n- Tumor in the bladder may cause symptoms such as blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine (peeing)",

    "description": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints. The hands, feet and wrists are commonly affected, but it can also cause problems in other parts of the body. There may be periods where your symptoms become worse, known as a flare-up or flare. A flare can be difficult to predict, but with treatment it is possible to decrease the number of flares and minimize or prevent long-term damage to the joints. Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis quickly is important because early treatment can help stop the condition getting worse and reduce the risk of further problems such as joint damage. \\n\\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system – which usually fights infection – attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making them swollen, stiff and painful. Over time, this can damage the joint itself, the cartilage and nearby bone. It's not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, although you are at an increased risk if you are a woman, you have a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, or you smoke. It can affect adults at any age, but most commonly starts between the ages of 40 and 50. About three times as many women as men are affected.\\n\\nThere is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, but early diagnosis and appropriate treatment enables many people with rheumatoid arthritis to have periods of months or even years between flares and to be able to lead full lives and continue regular employment.",

    "description": "Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. The main symptom of scabies is intense itching that's worse at night. It also causes a skin rash on areas where the mites have burrowed.  Scabies mites are called Sarcoptes scabiei. They feed using their mouths and front legs to burrow into the outer layer of skin (epidermis), where they lay eggs. After 3 to 4 days, the baby mites (larvae) hatch and move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults. Scabies like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock or breast creases. They can also hide under watch straps, bracelets or rings.\\n\\nScabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or through sexual contact. It's also possible – but rare – for scabies to be passed on by sharing clothing, towels and bedding with someone who's infected. It can take up to 8 weeks for the symptoms of scabies to appear after the initial infection. This is known as the incubation period. Scabies is widespread in densely populated areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas:\\n\\n- Africa\\n- Central and South America\\n- Northern and central Australia\\n- Caribbean Islands\\n- India\\n- Southeast Asia\\n\\nIn developed countries, scabies outbreaks can sometimes occur in places where there are lots of people, such as schools, nurseries and care homes.\\n\\nScabies can sometimes lead to a secondary skin infection if your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through excessive itching. Crusted scabies is a rare but more severe form of scabies, where a large number of mites are in the skin. This can develop in older people and those with a lowered immunity.",

    "condition": "Scarlet fever",
    "id": 127,
    "description": "Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that mainly affects children. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash. The illness is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as Group A Streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat. Scarlet fever usually follows a sore throat or a skin infection, like impetigo, caused by particular strains of Streptococcus bacteria. The symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop 2 to 5 days after infection. However, the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as 7 days. Speak to your doctor if:\\n\\n- Symptoms of scarlet fever do not get better in a week\\n- Have scarlet fever and chickenpox at the same time\\n- Ill again weeks after scarlet fever got better – this can be a sign of a complication like rheumatic fever\\n- Feeling unwell and have been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever\\n\\nRash\\n\\nDistinctive pink-red rash caused by scarlet fever develops 12 to 48 hours after symptoms like a sore throat or headache. Red blotches are the first sign of the rash. These turn into a fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch and looks like sunburn. It may also be itchy. On darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent. The rash usually starts on the chest and stomach, but soon spreads to other parts of the body, like the:\\n\\n- Ears\\n- Neck\\n- Elbows\\n- Inner thighs\\n- Groin\\n\\nThe rash doesn't usually spread to the face. However, the cheeks become flushed and the area just around the mouth stays quite pale. The rash will turn white if you press a glass on it. The rash usually fades after about a week, but the outer layers of skin, usually on the hands and feet, may peel for several weeks afterwards. Other symptoms of scarlet fever may include:\\n\\n- Swollen neck glands\\n- Loss of appetite\\n- Nausea or vomiting\\n- Red lines in the folds of the body, such as the armpit, which may last a couple of days after the rash has gone\\n- A white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue red and swollen (this is known as strawberry tongue)\\n- A general feeling of being unwell\\n\\nThe symptoms of scarlet fever will only develop in people susceptible to toxins produced by the Streptococcus bacteria. Most children over 10 years of age will have developed immunity to these toxins.",

The main symptom of shingles is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy blisters. These look like chickenpox. Sometimes shingles causes symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash. This includes symptoms like:\\n\\n- Headache\\n- Burning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area\\n- Feeling of being generally unwell\\n- A high temperature (fever)\\n\\n- Shingles rash\\n\\nThe shingles rash usually appears on one side of your body. It develops on the area of skin related to the affected nerve. New blisters can appear for up to a week. A few days after appearing they become yellowish in color, flatten and dry out. Scabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring. Most people with shingles experience a localized band of pain in the affected area. The pain may be a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe. You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender.",

    "condition": "Shortness of breath",
    "id": 129,
    "description": "Sudden shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty (dyspnea), is the most common reason for visiting a hospital accident and emergency department. It's also one of the most common reasons people call for an ambulance. It's normal to get out of breath when you've overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it's usually a warning sign of a medical condition. You should phone your doctor immediately if you have sudden unexpected shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart.\\n\\nIf you've struggled with your breathing for a while, don't ignore it. It could be you have a long-term condition, such as obesity, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which needs to be managed properly.\\n\\nSudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions.\\n- A problem with your lungs or airways. Sudden breathlessness could be an asthma attack. This means your airways have narrowed and you'll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You'll feel breathless because it's difficult to move air in and out of your airways.\\n\\n- Pneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It's usually caused by an infection, so you'll need to take antibiotics.\\n\\n- If you have COPD, it's likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse.\\n\\n- A heart problem. It's possible to have a \"silent\" heart attack without experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety. In this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you're having a heart attack.\\n\\n- Heart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of fluid inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult.\\n\\n- Breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate).\\n\\n- Panic attack or anxiety. A panic attack or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag can bring your breathing back to normal but should only be done when you are certain anxiety is the cause of your breathlessness.\\n\\nMore unusual causes, these include:\\n- A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)\\n- Pneumothorax – partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs\\n- Pulmonary embolism – a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung\\n- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis – a rare and poorly understood lung condition that causes scarring of the lungs\\n- Pleural effusion – a collection of fluid next to the lung\\n- Poorly controlled asthma\\n- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking\\n- Anemia – a low level of oxygen in the blood caused by a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen).\\n\\nMore unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are:\\n- Bronchiectasis – a lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough\\n- Pleural effusion – a collection of fluid next to the lung\\n- Narrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body\\n- Fequent panic attacks, which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths)",

Their speech may also sound nasal (as though they have a stuffy cold). The symptoms of sinusitis often clear up within a few weeks (acute sinusitis), although occasionally they can last three months or more (chronic sinusitis).\\n\\nIf your symptoms are mild and getting better, you don't usually need to see your doctor and can look after yourself at home.\\n\\nSee your doctor if:\\n\\n- Your symptoms are severe or getting worse\\n- Your symptoms haven't started to improve after around 7-10 days\\n- You experience episodes of sinusitis frequently",

    "description": "Sjögren's (pronounced Show-grin's) syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. The body’s immune system attacks glands that secrete fluid, such as the tear and saliva glands. The effects of Sjögren's syndrome can be widespread. Certain glands become inflamed, which reduces the production of tears and saliva, causing the main symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome, which are dry eyes and dry mouth. In women (who are most commonly affected), the glands that keep the vagina moist can also be affected, leading to vaginal dryness.\\n\\nSjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune condition, which means that instead of protecting the body from infection or illness, the immune system reacts abnormally and starts attacking healthy cells and tissue. In Sjögren's syndrome, the immune system attacks the tear and saliva glands, and other secretory glands throughout the body. The reasons for this remains unknown, but research suggests that it's triggered by a combination of genetic, environmental and, possibly, hormonal factors. Some people are thought to be more vulnerable to the syndrome when they're born and that certain events, such an infection, can trigger the problems with the immune system.\\n\\nHealthcare professionals classify Sjögren's syndrome as being either:\\n\\n- Primary – when the syndrome develops by itself and not as the result of another condition\\n- Secondary – when the syndrome develops in combination with another autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis",

    "description": "Slapped cheek syndrome (also called fifth disease or parvovirus B19) is a viral infection that's most common in children. But it can affect people of any age. It usually causes a bright red rash on the cheeks. Although the rash can look alarming, slapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in 1 to 3 weeks. Once you've had the infection, you're usually immune to it for life. However, slapped cheek syndrome can be more serious for some people. If you're pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice.\\n\\nSymptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4 to 14 days after becoming infected, but sometimes may not appear for up to 21 days. Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won't notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days:\\n\\n- Slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38C (100.4F)\\n- Runny nose\\n- Sore throat\\n- Headache\\n- Upset stomach\\n- Feeling generally unwell\\n\\nThe infection is most contagious during this initial period. In adults, these symptoms are often accompanied by joint pain and stiffness, which may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed.\\n\\nAfter a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks ('slapped cheeks') normally appears. Adults may not get this. By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious. After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy. The rashes will normally fade within a week or two, although occasionally the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress.",

These are called duodenal ulcers. Stomach and duodenal ulcers are sometimes called peptic ulcers. This information applies to both. Although the most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the middle of the abdomen (tummy). Not all stomach ulcers are painful. Some people experience:\\n\\n- Indigestion\\n- Heartburn\\n- Nausea (feeling sick)\\n\\nSpeak to your doctor immediately if:\\n\\n- Your symptoms persist\\n- You're vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds\\n- You're passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools\\n- You feel a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worse\\n\\nThese could be a sign of a serious complication. Stomach ulcers occur when the layer protecting the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down. This allows the stomach lining to become damaged. This is usually caused by:\\n\\n- An infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria\\n- Taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or aspirin – particularly if they're taken for a long time or at high doses\\n- There's little evidence that stress or certain foods causes stomach ulcers.",

    "id": 135,
    "description": "A stroke is a serious, life-threatening medical condition that happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. Strokes are a medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential. The sooner a person receives treatment for a stroke, the less damage to the brain is likely to occur. Even if the symptoms of a stroke go away, you or the person having a stroke should still go to hospital for an assessment. Immediate action required: Phone an ambulance immediately if:\\n\\n- You suspect you or someone else is having a stroke\\n- Do not drive if you suspect you have had a stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack).\\n\\nThe main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST. FAST stands for:\\n- Face – the face might drop on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth may have dropped, and their eyelid may droop\\n- Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm\\n- Speech – they might slur their speech or it might be garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake\\n- Time – it’s time to phone 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms in the FAST test identify most strokes, but occasionally a stroke can cause different symptoms which might include:\\n\\n- Complete paralysis of one side of the body\\n- Sudden loss or blurring of vision\\n- Difficulty understanding what others are saying\\n- Problems with balance and co-ordination\\n- Sudden and very severe headache\\n- Loss of feeling in one side of the body\\n\\nHowever, there are sometimes other causes for these symptoms. Like all organs, the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function. If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death. There are some things that can make you more likely to have a stroke or TIA:\\n\\n- Poor diet\\n- Lack of exercise\\n- Obesity\\n- Smoking\\n- Drinking too much alcohol\\n- High cholesterol\\n- High blood pressure (hypertension)\\n- Diabetes\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n\\nLifestyle changes can help control some of these risk factors. You may also need to take regular medication. Taking anticoagulant medication if you have an irregular heartbeat due to atrial fibrillation will help reduce the risk of stroke.",

    "description": "Tinnitus is the term for hearing sounds that come from inside your body, rather than from an outside source. It's often described as \"ringing in the ears\", although several sounds can be heard, including:\\n\\n- Buzzing\\n- Humming\\n- Grinding\\n- Hissing\\n- Whistling\\n\\nSome people may hear sounds similar to music or singing, and others hear noises that beat in time with their pulse (pulsatile tinnitus). You may also notice that your hearing is not as good as it used to be or you're more sensitive to everyday sounds (hyperacusis). Tinnitus is rarely a sign of a serious underlying condition. For some people it may come and go and only be a minor irritation. However, for some people, it can have a significant impact on everyday life and be very distressing, affect concentration, and cause problems such as difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression.\\n\\nIn many cases, tinnitus will get better gradually over time, either by disappearing or by the body getting used to it (habituation). But it's important to seek medical advice to see if an underlying cause can be found and treated, and to help you find ways to cope with the problem. You should see your GP if you continually or regularly hear sounds such as buzzing, ringing or humming in your ears. Tinnitus can develop gradually over time or occur suddenly. It's not clear exactly why it happens, but it often occurs along with some degree of hearing loss.",

    "description": "Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils. It's usually caused by a viral infection or, less commonly, a bacterial infection. Tonsillitis is a common condition in children, teenagers and young adults. The symptoms of tonsillitis include:\\n\\n- Sore throat and pain when swallowing\\n- Earache\\n- High temperature (fever) over 38C (100.4F)\\n- Coughing\\n- Headache\\n\\nSymptoms usually pass within three to four days. Non-urgent advice: Contact your doctor if:\\n\\n- Symptoms last longer than four days and don't show any signs of improvement\\n- Symptoms are severe – for example, if you're unable to eat or drink due to the pain, or you have difficulty breathing\\n\\nIf your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, they may prescribe antibiotics. Typical signs of a bacterial infection include white pus-filled spots on the tonsils, no cough and swollen or tender lymph glands.\\n\\nThe tonsils are two small glands that sit on either side of the throat. In young children, they help to fight germs and act as a barrier against infection. When the tonsils become infected, they isolate the infection and stop it spreading further into the body. As a child's immune system develops and gets stronger, the tonsils become less important and usually shrink. In most people, the body is able to fight infection without the tonsils. Removal of the tonsils is usually only recommended if they're causing problems, such as severe or repeated episodes of tonsillitis.\\n\\nMost cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection, such as the viruses that cause the common cold or flu virus (influenza). Some cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection, typically a strain of bacteria called group A streptococcus bacteria. These types of infections spread easily, so it's important to try to avoid passing the infection on to others by:\\n\\n- Staying away from public places, such as work, school or nursery, until your GP says it's safe to return (usually after the symptoms have passed)\\n- Coughing and sneezing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue \\n- Washing hands before eating, after going to the toilet and, if possible, after coughing and sneezing",

    "condition": "Trigeminal neuralgia",
    "id": 139,
    "description": "Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, severe facial pain, described as sharp, shooting or like an electric shock. It usually occurs in sudden short attacks lasting from a few seconds to about two minutes, which stop just as abruptly. In the vast majority of cases it affects part or all of one side of the face, with the pain most commonly felt in the lower part of the face. Very occasionally it affects both sides of the face, but not normally at the same time. People with the condition may experience attacks of pain regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. In severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day. It's possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (known as a period of remission), although these periods of remission tend to get shorter with time. Some people may then go on to develop a more continuous aching, throbbing and burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks.\\n\\nTypically, the attacks of pain are brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind (even a slight breeze or air conditioning) or movement of the face or head. Sometimes, the pain can occur without any trigger whatsoever. Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult and it can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression.\\n\\nIn the vast majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the largest nerve inside the skull, which transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain. This compression is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull. In rare cases, trigeminal neuralgia can occur as a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve, caused by an underlying condition such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumor.",

    "description": "Transverse myelitis is a rare neurological condition. It's caused by inflammation (swelling) of the spinal cord. The swelling damages the nerves and can leave permanent scars or lesions. The scars or lesions interrupt the communication between the nerves in the spinal cord and the rest of the body. 'Transverse' refers to the swelling being across the width of the spinal cord. It's also sometimes used to describe swelling that only affects part of the width of the spinal cord. The symptoms of transverse myelitis can include:\\n- Muscle weakness in the legs, and sometimes the arms\\n- Mobility problems\\n- Unusual sensations and numbness\\n- Bladder problems\\n- Bowel problems\\n- Sexual problems\\n- Pain\\n\\nTransverse myelitis can happen to anyone at any time in their life. In most cases there might only be one episode of symptoms, but sometimes it can happen repeatedly. Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of MS or another condition. There are several different causes of transverse myelitis. Sometimes a cause isn't found, and this is called idiopathic transverse myelitis.\\n\\n- Autoimmune disease\\n- Viral infection\\n- Bacterial infection\\n- Cancer",

Ulcerative colitis affects the innermost lining of your large intestine, also called the colon, and rectum. In most people, symptoms usually develop over time, rather than suddenly. Ulcerative colitis can be draining and can sometimes lead to life-threatening complications. While it has no known cure, there are several new treatments that can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of the disease and bring about long-term remission. Ulcerative colitis symptoms can vary, depending on the severity of inflammation and where it occurs. Signs and symptoms may include:\\n\\n- Diarrhea, often with blood or pus\\n- Rectal bleeding — passing small amount of blood with stool\\n- Abdominal pain and cramping\\n- Rectal pain\\n- Urgency to defecate\\n- Inability to defecate despite urgency\\n- Weight loss\\n- Fatigue\\n- Fever\\n- In children, failure to grow\\n\\nMost people with ulcerative colitis have mild to moderate symptoms. The course of ulcerative colitis may vary, with some people having long periods when it goes away. This is called remission. See your health care provider if you experience a persistent change in your bowel habits or if you have signs and symptoms such as:\\n\\n- Abdominal pain\\n- Blood in your stool\\n- Ongoing diarrhea that doesn't respond to nonprescription medications\\n- Diarrhea that awakens you from sleep\\n- An unexplained fever lasting more than a day or two\\n\\nAlthough ulcerative colitis usually isn't fatal, it's a serious disease.

    "description": "Urinary incontinence is the unintentional passing of urine. It is a common problem and is thought to affect millions of people worldwide. Urinary incontinence affects both men and women, but it tends to be more common in women overall. The symptoms of urinary incontinence depend on the type you have. There are several types of urinary incontinence, but the most common are:\\n\\n- Stress incontinence – when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure, for example when you cough or laugh\\n- Urge incontinence – when urine leaks as you feel a sudden, intense urge to pass urine, or soon afterwards\\n- It is also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence.\\n\\nStress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening or damaging of the muscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter.\\n\\nUrge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscle, which controls the bladder. Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence developing, including:\\n\\n- Pregnancy and vaginal birth\\n- Obesity\\n- Family history of incontinence\\n- Increasing age – although incontinence is not an inevitable part of ageing",

    "description": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections that affect the bladder, the kidneys and the tubes connected to them.  Anyone can get them, but they're particularly common in women. Some women experience them regularly (called recurrent UTIs).  UTIs can be painful and uncomfortable, but usually pass within a few days and can be treated with antibiotics. Infections of the bladder (cystitis) or urethra (tube that carries urine out of the body) are known as lower UTIs. These can cause:\\n\\n - A need to pee more often than usual\\n- Pain or discomfort when peeing\\n- Sudden urges to pee\\n- Feeling as though you're unable to empty your bladder fully\\n- Pain low down in your tummy\\n- Urine that's cloudy, foul-smelling or contains blood\\n- Feeling generally unwell, achy and tired\\n\\nInfections of the kidneys or ureters (tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder) are known as upper UTIs. These can cause the same symptoms as lower UTIs and also:\\n\\n- A high temperature (fever) of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above\\n- Pain in your sides or back\\n- Shivering and chills\\n- Feeling and being sick\\n- Confusion\\n- Agitation or restlessness\\n\\nUpper UTIs can be serious if left untreated, as they could damage the kidneys or spread to the bloodstream.  Urgent advice: Speak to your doctor urgently if:\\n\\n- You have a very high temperature, or feel hot and shivery\\n- Have a low temperature below 36°C\\n- Are confused or drowsy\\n- Have pain in the lower tummy or in the back, just under the ribs\\n- Can see blood in your pee",

    "description": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are fairly common, but not usually serious. They can be effectively treated with antibiotics. A UTI may be classed as either:\\n\\n- An upper UTI – if it's a kidney infection or an infection of the ureters, the tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder\\n- A lower UTI – if it's a bladder infection (cystitis) or an infection of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. If you think your child is unwell and could have a UTI, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Although UTIs aren't normally a serious type of infection, they should be diagnosed and treated quickly to reduce the risk of complications. It can be difficult to tell whether your child has a UTI, as the symptoms can be vague and young children can't easily communicate how they feel. General signs that may suggest your child is unwell include:\\n\\n- A high temperature (fever)\\n- Vomiting\\n- Tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)\\n- Irritability\\n- Poor feeding\\n- Not gaining weight properly\\n- In very young children, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\\n\\nMore specific signs that your child may have a UTI include:\\n- Pain or a burning sensation when peeing\\n- Needing to pee frequently\\n- Deliberately holding in their pee\\n- A change in their normal toilet habits, such as wetting themselves or wetting the bed\\n- Pain in their tummy (abdomen), side or lower back\\n- Unpleasant-smelling pee\\n- Blood in their pee\\n- Cloudy pee\\n\\nThere are many ways this can happen, including:\\n\\n- When a child wipes their bottom and soiled toilet paper comes into contact with their genitals – this is more of a problem for girls than boys because girls' bottoms are much nearer the urethra\\n- Babies getting small particles of poo in their urethra when they soil their nappies – particularly if they squirm a lot when being changed",

    "description": "Vaginal cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the vagina. Cancer that begins in the vagina is called primary vaginal cancer. Cancer that begins in another part of the body – such as the cervix, womb or ovaries – and spreads to the vagina is known as secondary vaginal cancer.  The most common symptom of vaginal cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding. This includes:\\n\\n- Bleeding between your normal periods, or after sex\\n- Bleeding after the menopause (post-menopausal bleeding)\\n- Smelly or bloody vaginal discharge\\n- Pain during sex\\n- Pain when urinating\\n- Needing to urinate more frequently than usual\\n- Blood in your urine\\n- Pelvic pain\\n- An itch or lump in your vagina\\n\\nThe exact causes of vaginal cancer are unknown, but things that may increase your risk of developing it include:\\n\\n- Being infected with a particularly persistent type of the human papilloma virus (HPV), which can be spread during sex\\n- Your age – 7 out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer affect women and anyone with a vagina over 60\\n- A previous history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) – abnormal cells in the vagina or cervix that can sometimes become cancerous\\n\\nAs there is a possible link with HPV, it may be possible to reduce your risk of vaginal cancer by practicing safe sex. The HPV vaccination, which is routinely offered to girls who are 12 to 13 years old, provides protection against 2 strains of HPV thought to be responsible for most cases of vaginal and cervical cancer.",

This feeling may be barely noticeable, or it may be so severe that you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks. Attacks of vertigo can develop suddenly and last for a few seconds, or they may last much longer. If you have severe vertigo, your symptoms may be constant and last for several days, making normal life very difficult. Other symptoms associated with vertigo may include:\\n\\n- Loss of balance – which can make it difficult to stand or walk\\n- Feeling sick or being sick\\n- Dizziness\\n\\nVertigo is commonly caused by a problem with the way balance works in the inner ear, although it can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain. Causes of vertigo may include:\\n\\n- Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) – where certain head movements trigger vertigo\\n- Migraines – severe headaches\\n- Labyrinthitis – an inner ear infection\\n- Vestibular neuronitis – inflammation of the vestibular nerve, which runs into the inner ear and sends messages to the brain that help to control balance\\n\\nDepending on the condition causing vertigo, you may experience additional symptoms, such as a high temperature, ringing in your ears (tinnitus) and hearing loss.",

    "description": "Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that can't function properly. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called hemoglobin. Anemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell. There are several different types of anemia, and each one has a different cause. For example, iron deficiency anemia, which occurs when the body doesn't contain enough iron. Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy. A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including:\\n\\n- Extreme tiredness\\n- A lack of energy\\n- Pins and needles (paresthesias)\\n- Sore and red tongue\\n- Mouth ulcers\\n- Muscle weakness\\n- Disturbed vision\\n- Psychological problems, which may include depression and confusion\\n- Problems with memory, understanding and judgement\\n\\nSome of these problems can also occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, but don't have anemia. It's important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible because, although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible.",

Vomiting is the body's way of getting rid of harmful substances from the stomach, or it may be a reaction to something that has irritated the gut.  One of the most common causes of vomiting in adults is gastroenteritis. This is an infection of the gut usually caused by bacteria or a virus. It'll normally improve within a few days.

    "description": "Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. It causes repeated coughing bouts that can last for 2 to 3 months or more, and can make babies and young children in particular very ill. Whooping cough is spread in the droplets of the coughs or sneezes of someone with the infection. The first symptoms of whooping cough are similar to those of a cold, such as a runny nose, red and watery eyes, a sore throat, and a slightly raised temperature. Intense coughing bouts start about a week later. The bouts usually last a few minutes at a time and tend to be more common at night. Coughing usually brings up thick mucus and may be followed by vomiting. Between coughs, you or your child may gasp for breath – this may cause a 'whoop' sound, although not everyone has this.\\n\\nThe strain of coughing can cause the face to become very red, and there may be some slight bleeding under the skin or in the eyes. Young children can sometimes briefly turn blue (cyanosis) if they have trouble breathing – this often looks worse than it is and their breathing should start again quickly. In very young babies, the cough may not be particularly noticeable, but there may be brief periods where they stop breathing. The bouts will eventually start to become less severe and less frequent over time, but it may be a few months before they stop completely. See your doctor if you or your child:\\n\\n- Has symptoms of whooping cough\\n- Has had a cough for more than 3 weeks\\n- Has a cough that is particularly severe or is getting worse\\n- Have significant breathing difficulties, such as long periods of breathlessness or choking, shallow breathing, periods where breathing stops, or dusky, blue skin\\n- Develop signs of serious complications of whooping cough, such as fits (seizures) or pneumonia",

    "description": "Wilms’ tumor is a type of kidney cancer in children. It most often affects children under the age of 5. More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organizations to help you through this difficult time.\\n\\nWilms’ tumor is a type of kidney cancer that was named after Dr Max Wilms, who first described it. It's thought to come from very specialized cells in the embryo known as metanephric blastema. These cells are involved in the development of the child’s kidneys while they are in the womb. The cells usually disappear at birth, but in many children with Wilms’ tumor, clusters of primitive kidneys cells, called nephrogenic rests can still be found.\\n\\nThe most common symptom is a swollen abdomen, which is usually painless. Sometimes a parent may feel a lump in the abdomen which can be quite large. Occasionally, the tumor may bleed slightly and this can irritate the kidney and may be painful. There may be blood in your child’s urine (pee), or their blood pressure may be raised. The child may also have a high temperature (fever), upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite.",
