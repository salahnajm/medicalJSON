Most cases are infectious, although gastroenteritis may occur after ingestion of drugs and chemical toxins (eg, metals, plant substances).

Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Diagnosis is clinical or by stool culture, although polymerase chain reaction testing and immunoassays are increasingly used. Treatment is symptomatic, although some parasitic and some bacterial infections require specific anti-infective therapy.",

These symptoms usually start soon after being exposed to an allergen. Some people only get allergic rhinitis for a few months at a time because they're sensitive to seasonal allergens, such as tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round. Most people with allergic rhinitis have mild symptoms that can be easily and effectively treated. But for some symptoms can be severe and persistent, causing sleep problems and interfering with everyday life. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time, but this can take many years and it's unlikely that the condition will disappear completely.",

However, some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily life. Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including panic disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia).

Within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe. Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. You may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience diarrhea.",

    "description": "Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it. It's much less common in men than women. The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged. Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge.",

    "description": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long term (chronic) neurological condition that affects the nervous and immune systems. People with ME/CFS experience severe pain and fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise (PEM). This is when the body is not able to recover after using even small amounts of energy. This fatigue feels very different from ordinary tiredness. It might take a day or 2 to kick in after physical, mental, or emotional exertion. ME/CFS affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups. It doesn't go away with sleep or rest and affects everyday life. It can sometimes be diagnosed as post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS).",

It's a common type of urinary tract infection (UTI), particularly in women, and is usually more of a nuisance than a cause for serious concern. Mild cases will often get better by themselves within a few days. However, some people experience episodes of cystitis frequently and may need regular or long-term treatment. There's also a chance that cystitis could lead to a more serious kidney infection in some cases, so it's important to seek professional advice if your symptoms don't improve.",

    "description": "Everyone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy. Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time. While some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it's actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. It impacts people of all genders and ages – including children. Studies show that around 4% of children  between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious. With the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.",

The patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid at first, but become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky over time. The patches may clear up on their own eventually, but this can take weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can recur.",

    "description": "Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain and is defined by repeated seizures. Symptoms of epilepsy:\\nThe main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are different types of seizure, depending on which part of the brain it affects. The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.\\n\\nThe severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a \"trance-like\" state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).\\n\\nSome people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.\\n\\nPeople with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms. Seizures can occur when you're awake or asleep. The type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are:\\n\\n1. Focal (or partial) seizures – where only a small part of the brain is affected\\n2. Generalized seizures – where most or all of the brain is affected",

It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 will have it to some degree. See your doctor if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted). Erectile dysfunction can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. Physical causes include:\\n\\n-Narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis – commonly associated with high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol or diabetes\\n- Hormonal problems\\n- Surgery or injury\\n\\nPsychological causes of ED include:\\n- Anxiety\\n- Depression\\n- Relationship problems\\n\\nSometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner. If this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). If you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical. Erectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medications.",

    "description": "A febrile seizure is a fit that can happen when a child has a fever. Febrile seizures are also sometimes called febrile convulsions. They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren't serious. Around one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. They most often occur between the ages of six months and three years. During a febrile seizure, the child's body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. Some children may wet themselves. This is known as a tonic clonic seizure.\\n\\nWhat to do during a seizure\\n\\nIf your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury. Stay with your child and try to make a note of how long the seizure lasts.\\n\\nIf it's your child's first seizure, or it lasts longer than five minutes, take them to the nearest hospital as soon as possible, or call an ambulance. While it's unlikely that there's anything seriously wrong, it's best to be sure. Almost all children make a complete recovery after having a febrile seizure.",

It's also suggested that some people are more likely to develop fibromyalgia because of genes inherited from their parents. In many cases, the condition appears to be triggered by a physically or emotionally stressful event.",

Flu isn't the same as the common cold. Flu is caused by a different group of viruses and the symptoms tend to start more suddenly, be more severe and last longer. Some of the main symptoms of flu include:\\n- A high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\\n- Tiredness and weakness\\n- Headache\\n- General aches and pains\\n- Cough\\nCold-like symptoms, such as a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat, can also be caused by flu, but they tend to be less severe than the other symptoms you have. Flu can make you feel so exhausted and unwell that you have to stay in bed and rest until you feel better.",

Over 85% of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinoma, which means the cancer started in the gland cells lining the gallbladder. Cancer that starts in the skin-like cells that line the gallbladder is known as squamous cell cancer.\\n\\nThe gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that's located underneath the liver. It's main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats. It passes from the liver through a series of channels (bile ducts) into the gallbladder, where it's stored. Over time, bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. The gallbladder is a useful but not essential organ, which can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.",

It usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus becoming weakened. GERD causes symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in the back of the mouth. It may just be an occasional nuisance for some people, but for others it can be a severe, lifelong problem. Symptoms of GERD:\\n\\n- Heartburn (an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest that often occurs after eating)\\n- Acid reflux (where stomach acid comes back up into your mouth and causes an unpleasant, sour taste)\\n- Esophagitis (a sore, inflamed esophagus)\\n- Bad breath\\n- Bloating and belching\\n- Pain when swallowing and/or difficulty swallowing",

Gout can be extremely painful and debilitating, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further attacks. Signs and symptoms of gout:\\n\\n- Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers.\\n- Severe pain in one or more joints\\n- Joint feeling hot and very tender\\n- Swelling in and around the affected joint\\n- Red, shiny skin over the affected joint\\n\\nSymptoms develop rapidly over a few hours and typically last three to 10 days. After this time the pain should pass and the joint should return to normal. Almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point, usually within a year.",

When to seek medical advice\\n\\nSee your doctor if you have persistent or severe symptoms of hemorrhoids. You should always get any rectal bleeding checked out, so your doctor can rule out more potentially serious causes",

    "description": "Most headaches are not serious. In many cases, you can treat your headache at home. When to get professional advice:\\n\\n- Your headache is getting worse despite taking painkillers\\n- Painful or frequent headaches affect your daily activities or cause you to miss work\\n- Your headache does not go away and gets worse over time\\n- Your headache is triggered suddenly by coughing, laughing, sneezing, changing posture, or physical effort\\n- You have a headache and you feel weak\\n- Slurred speech or memory loss\\n- High temperature, feel hot and shivery, and have a stiff neck or a rash\\n- Vision problems\\n- Severe pain and redness in one of your eyes.\\n\\nTypes of Headaches:\\n\\n1. Tension headaches:\\nTension headaches are the most common type of headache. They're what we think of as normal, 'everyday' headaches. They feel like a constant ache that affects both sides of the head, as though a tight band is stretched around it. Normally, tension headaches are not severe enough to prevent you doing everyday activities. They usually last for 30 minutes to several hours, but can last for several days.\\n\\n2. Migraines are less common than tension headaches. They're usually felt as a severe, throbbing pain at the front or side of the head. Some people also have other symptoms, such as: nausea, vomiting, increased sensitivity to light or sound. Migraines can stop you carrying out your normal daily activities. They usually last at least a couple of hours. Some people find they need to stay in bed for days at a time.\\n\\n3. Cluster headaches:\\nCluster headaches are a rare type of headache. They occur in clusters for a month or two at a time around the same time of year. Cluster headaches are excruciatingly painful. They cause intense pain around one eye, and often occur with other symptoms, such as watering or red eye, blocked or runny nose",

    "condition": "Hiatal hernia",
    "id": 62,
    "description": "A hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (\"hiatal\") in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle between the chest and the abdomen (tummy). A hiatal hernia itself rarely has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).\\nGERD is where stomach acid leaks into the esophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatal hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the esophagus from working properly. Your esophagus can become severely irritated, because it's not protected against stomach acid. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems (dysphagia).\\nThere are 2 main types of hiatal hernia. They are:\\n1. Sliding hiatal hernias – hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatal hernias are of this type)\\n2. Para-esophageal hiatal hernias – also called rolling hiatal hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the esophagus (about 5-15% of hiatal hernias are of this type)\\n\\nThey can usually be diagnosed using an X-ray or an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body.",

    "description": "Lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes. In Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. There are two main types of lymphomas:\\n\\n1. Hodgkin’s Lymphoma\\n2. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma .\\n\\nThe way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy. This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.",

The damage to the brain gets worse over time. It can affect movement, cognition (perception, awareness, thinking, judgement) and mental health. People can start to show the symptoms of Huntington's disease at almost any age. Most will develop problems between the ages of 30 and 50. The condition gradually gets worse over the years. \\n\\nEarly symptoms:\\nBehavioral changes are often the first symptoms of Huntington's disease. These changes often include: a lack of emotions and not recognizing the needs of others, periods of aggression, excitement, depression, antisocial behavior and anger, apathy - causing a person to appear lazy or have a lack of interest in hygiene and self care, difficulty concentrating on more than one task and handling complex situations, irritability and impulsiveness\\n\\nFurther symptoms of Huntington's might include:\\nPsychiatric problems - some people develop obsessive behaviors, delusional thoughts or behaviors, stubbornness, lack of self awareness, or suicidal thoughts, uncontrollable movements of the face, jerking, clicking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body, difficulty eating because the mouth and throat muscles don't work properly which can lead to choking and chest infections, communication problems - difficulty putting thoughts into words and slurring of speech, sexual problems - a loss of interest in sex or making inappropriate sexual demands, balance problems",

When your glucose (sugar) level is too low, your body doesn't have enough energy to carry out its activities. Hypoglycemia is most commonly associated with diabetes, and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard. In rare cases, it's possible for a person who doesn't have diabetes to experience hypoglycemia. It can be triggered by malnutrition, binge drinking or certain conditions, such as Addison's disease.\\n\\nMost people will have some warning that their blood glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall low. Typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycemia can lose consciousness. It's also possible for hypoglycemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking",

    "description": "Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It's not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment. Impetigo is the most common skin infection in young children, but it can affect people of all ages. There are two types of impetigo:\\n\\n1. Non-bullous impetigo – the most common type\\nThe symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected. The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin. After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. The sores aren't painful, but they may be itchy. It's important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people. Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.\\nBullous impetigo\\nThe symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1-2cm across. The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring. The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it's important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin. Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.",

    "condition": "Indigestion",
    "id": 68,
    "description": "Indigestion can be pain or discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia) or burning pain behind the breastbone (heartburn). Dyspepsia and heartburn may occur together or on their own. Symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking. Common associated symptoms include:\\n- Feeling full or bloated\\n- Feeling sick (nausea)\\n- Belching\\n- Bringing up (regurgitating) fluid or food into the esophagus\\nIndigestion may be caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful. The majority of people with indigestion don't have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching). In most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress or taking certain medications.",

It's a common problem thought to regularly affect around one in every three people, and is particularly common in elderly people. If you have insomnia, you may:\\n- Find it difficult to fall asleep\\n- Lie awake for long periods at night\\n- Wake up several times during the night\\n- Wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep\\n- Not feel refreshed when you get up\\n- Find it hard to nap during the day, despite feeling tired\\n- Feel tired and irritable during the day and have difficulty concentrating\\nOccasional episodes of insomnia may come and go without causing any serious problems, but for some people it can last for months or even years at a time. Persistent insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life. It can limit what you're able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues.\\n\\nHow much sleep do I need?\\nThere are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different. On average, a \"normal\" amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.",

    "description": "Iron deficiency anemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells. Iron is used to produce red blood cells, which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won't get as much oxygen as they usually would. There are several different types of anemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type. Other types of anemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body. Many people with iron deficiency anemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anemia develops. The most common symptoms include:\\n\\n- Tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)\\n- Shortness of breath\\n- Noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations)\\n- Pale complexion\\n\\nLess common symptoms include:\\n- Headache\\n- Hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus)\\n- Altered sense of taste\\n- Feeling itchy\\n- Sore or abnormally smooth tongue\\n- Hair loss\\n- A desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica)\\n- Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\\n- Painful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth\\n- Spoon-shaped nails",

It's more serious than cystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful. If treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn't cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn't treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage. Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side.\\n\\nSee your doctor if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. Most kidney infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers.\\n\\nA kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called E. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys.",

    "description": "Kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 to 60. They're quite common, with around three in 20 men and up to two in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives. The medical term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if they cause severe pain it's known as renal colic.\\n\\nSmall kidney stones may go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine. But it's fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the:\\n* Ureter – the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder\\n* Urethra – the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body\\n* A blockage can cause severe pain in the abdomen or groin and sometimes causes a urinary tract infection (UTI).\\n\\nThe waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump. This is more likely to happen if you don't drink enough fluids, if you're taking some types of medication, or if you have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine.\\n\\nAfter a kidney stone has formed, your body will try to pass it out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder).",

Symptoms of laryngitis can begin suddenly and usually get worse over a period of two to three days. Common symptoms of laryngitis include:\\n\\n- Hoarseness\\n- Difficulty speaking\\n- Sore throat\\n- Mild fever\\n- Irritating cough\\n- A constant need to clear your throat\\n\\nThe hoarse voice and speaking difficulties usually get worse each day you're ill and may last for up to a week after the other symptoms have gone. In a few cases, the larynx can swell and cause breathing difficulties. This isn't common in adults but can occur in young children who have smaller, narrower windpipes. Laryngitis is often linked to another illness, such as a cold, flu, throat infection (pharyngitis) or tonsillitis, so you might also have other symptoms such as:\\n\\n- A headache\\n- Swollen glands\\n- Runny nose\\n- Pain when swallowing\\n- Feeling tired and achy",

It usually occurs in the calf muscles, although it can affect any part of your leg, including your feet and thighs. After the cramping has passed, you may have pain and tenderness in your leg for several hours. Three out of four cases occur at night during sleep.\\n\\nLeg cramps can occur for no apparent reason, known as idiopathic leg cramps, or as a symptom or complication of a health condition, known as secondary leg cramps. Causes of secondary leg cramps can include:\\n\\n- Pregnancy\\n- Exercise\\n- Certain types of medication, such as statins (medicines that help lower cholesterol levels)\\n- Liver disease\\n\\nDuring a cramp, your muscles suddenly contract (shorten), causing pain in your leg. This is known as a spasm, and you cannot control the affected muscle. The cramp can last from a few seconds to 10 minutes. When the spasm passes, you will be able to control the affected muscle again.",

    "description": "There are more than 100 different types of liver disease. The liver is the second largest organ in the body. It works hard, performing hundreds of complex functions, including:\\n\\n- Fighting infections and illness\\n- Removing toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, from the body\\n- Controlling cholesterol levels\\n- Helping blood to clot (thicken)\\n- Releasing bile, a liquid that breaks down fats and aids digestion\\n\\nLiver disease doesn't usually cause any obvious signs or symptoms until it's fairly advanced and the liver is damaged. At this stage, possible symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss and jaundice. Types of liver disease:\\n\\n- Alcohol-related liver disease – where the liver is damaged after years of alcohol misuse, this can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver)\\n- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease – a build-up of fat within liver cells, usually seen in overweight people or those who are obese\\n- Hepatitis – which is inflammation (swelling) of the liver caused by a viral infection or exposure to harmful substances such as alcohol\\n- Hemochromatosis – an inherited disorder where there's a gradual build-up of iron in the body, usually around the liver\\n- Primary biliary cirrhosis – a rare, long-term type of liver disease that damages the bile ducts in the liver\\n\\nAll types of liver disease can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), not just alcohol-related liver disease. Three of the main causes of liver disease are:\\n- Obesity\\n- Undiagnosed hepatitis infection\\n- Alcohol misuse\\n\\nThese causes of liver disease are all preventable.",

    "description": "Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer.  There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition eventually develop symptoms including:\\n\\n-A persistent cough\\n- Coughing up blood\\n- Persistent breathlessness\\n- Unexplained tiredness and weight loss\\n- An ache or pain when breathing or coughing\\n\\nTypes of lung cancer:\\n- Cancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. There are 2 main types of primary lung cancer. These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts. They are:\\n\\n1. Non-small-cell lung cancer – the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases; can be either squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma\\n2. mall-cell lung cancer – a less common type that usually spreads faster than non-small-cell lung cancer\\n\\nThe type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended. \\n\\nLung cancer mainly affects older people. It's rare in people younger than 40, and the rates of lung cancer rise sharply with age. Lung cancer is most commonly diagnosed in people aged 70 to 74. Although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the main cause (accounting for over 85% of cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances.",

    "description": "Lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. There are some types of lupus that just affect the skin – such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects. However, the term \"lupus\" is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs.\\n\\nSymptoms range from mild to severe, and many people will have long periods with few or no symptoms before experiencing a sudden flare-up, where their symptoms are particularly severe. Even mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person’s quality of life. SLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are:\\n\\n- Fatigue (extreme tiredness)\\n- Rashes – particularly on the face, wrists and hands\\n- Joint pain and swelling\\n\\nAs the symptoms of SLE can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose.\\n\\nWhat causes lupus?\\nSLE is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs. As with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in certain people.",

Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and moorland areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Lyme disease is usually easier to treat the earlier it's diagnosed. Many people with early symptoms of Lyme disease develop a circular rash around the tick bite. The rash:\\n\\n- Usually develops around 3 to 30 days after you've been bitten\\n- Often described as looking like a bull's-eye on a dart board\\n- Red and the edges may feel slightly raised\\n- May get bigger over several days or weeks\\n- Typically around 15 cm (6 inches) across, but it can be much larger or smaller\\n\\nSome people may develop several rashes in different parts of their body. Around 1 in 3 people with Lyme disease won't develop a rash. Other symptoms of Lyme disease:\\n- Tiredness (fatigue)\\n- Muscle pain\\n- Joint pain\\n- Headaches\\n- High temperature (fever)\\n- Chills\\n- Neck stiffness",

Other symptoms of lymphedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them. Lymphedema can get worse if it's not treated, so you should speak to a doctor if you think you may have the condition.\\n\\nLymphedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. This is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. Its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues. Abnormal development of the lymphatic system, damage to it, and/or an increase in fluid in the body tissues can all lead to lymphedema. There are two main types of lymphoedema:\\n\\n- Primary lymphedema – caused by faulty genes affecting the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually occurs in early adulthood\\n- Secondary lymphedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system, often due to an infection, injury, cancer treatment, inflammation of the limb or a lack of limb movement",

    "description": "Measles is an infection that spreads very easily. It's unpleasant and can sometimes have serious complications. Having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to prevent it. Anyone can get measles if they haven't been vaccinated or they haven't had it before. It's most common in young children. Measles usually clears in around 7 to 10 days. The first symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected. These can include:\\n\\n- Cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough\\n- Sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light\\n- Watery eyes\\n- Swollen eyes\\n- High temperature (fever), which may reach around 40°C (104°F)\\n- Small greyish-white spots in the mouth\\n- Aches and pains\\n- Loss of appetite\\n- Tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy\\n\\nThe measles rash appears around 2 to 4 days after the initial symptoms and normally fades after about a week. The rash:\\n\\n- Is made up of small red-brown, flat or slightly raised spots that may join together into larger blotchy patches\\n- Usually first appears on the head or neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body\\n- Is slightly itchy for some people\\n- Red spotty rash\\n\\nIs measles serious?\\nMeasles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It's highly unlikely you'll get it again. However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).",

Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include:\\n\\n- High temperature (fever) over 37.5C (99.5F) being sick\\n- Headache\\n- Blotchy rash that doesn't fade when a glass is rolled over it (this won't always develop)\\n- Stiff neck\\n- Dislike of bright lights\\n- Drowsiness or unresponsiveness\\n- Seizures (fits)\\n\\nThese symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear. You should get medical advice as soon as possible if you're concerned that you or your child could have meningitis.\\n\\nMeningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial meningitis is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis. Infections that cause meningitis can be spread through:\\n\\n- Sneezing\\n- Coughing\\n- Kissing\\n- Sharing utensils, cutlery and toothbrushes\\n\\nMeningitis is usually caught from people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat but aren't ill themselves.",

    "description": "Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of MND. MND happens when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, called motor neurons, stop working properly and die prematurely. This is known as neurodegeneration. Motor neurons control muscle activity like:\\n\\n- Gripping\\n- Walking\\n- Speaking\\n- Swallowing\\n- Breathing\\n\\nAs MND progresses, it can become more difficult to do some or all of these activities. The symptoms of MND start gradually over weeks and months. They tend to appear on one side of the body first and get progressively worse.\\n\\nEarly symptoms\\n\\nSometimes the early symptoms are mistaken for similar conditions that also affect the nervous system.\\n\\nAs MND becomes more advanced, more parts and functions of the body are affected. This can make you more likely to experience infections, like chest infections, which can cause your condition to get worse quicker.\\n\\n- Muscular symptoms\\n- Speaking and swallowing difficulties\\n- Saliva problems\\n- Excessive yawning\\n- Emotional changes\\n- Changes to mental abilities\\n- Breathing difficulties\\n\\nAs MND progresses to its final phase, you might experience:\\n\\n- Increasing body paralysis, which means you'll need help with most daily activities\\n- Significant shortness of breath\\n\\nEventually, non-invasive breathing assistance won't be enough to make up for the loss of normal lung function. At this stage, more medication can help to reduce symptoms of breathlessness and anxiety related to it.",

Multiple myeloma affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow. Myeloma does not usually take the form of a lump or tumor. Instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells. Myeloma often affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. Commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs.\\n\\nIn the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It's often only suspected or diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test. However, myeloma will eventually cause a wide range of problems, including:\\n\\n- A persistent dull ache or specific areas of tenderness in your bones\\n -Weak bones that break (fracture) easily\\n- Tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath (caused by anemia)\\n- Repeated infections\\n- Less commonly, bruising and unusual bleeding – such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods\\n\\nSpeak to your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to get a proper diagnosis.",

    "description": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that affects the brain and/or spinal cord. It can cause symptoms like problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance. It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability. In many cases, it’s possible to treat symptoms. It's often diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. It's about two to three times more common in women than men. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a wide range of symptoms and can affect any part of the body. It affects everyone differently. The symptoms are unpredictable. Some people's symptoms develop and worsen over time, while for others, they come and go. Periods when symptoms get worse are known as relapses. Periods when symptoms improve or disappear are known as remissions. Some of the most common symptoms include:\\n\\n- Muscle spasms, stiffness and weakness\\n- Vision problems\\n- Abnormal sensations\\n- Mobility problems\\n- Pain\\n- Bladder problems\\n- Bowel problems\\n- Sexual problems\\n- Speech and swallowing difficulties\\n- Fatigue\\n- Mental health issues\\n- Problems with thinking, learning and planning\\n\\nWhat happens when someone has MS? MS is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it. In the case of MS, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. This is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body. The attacks cause the myelin sheath to become inflamed in small patches (plaques or lesions). This can be seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. These patches of inflammation can disrupt the messages travelling along the nerves. It can slow them down, jumble them, send them the wrong way, or stop them from getting through completely. This disruption leads to the symptoms and signs of MS.\\n\\nWhen the inflammation goes away, it can leave behind scarring of the myelin sheath (sclerosis). These attacks, particularly if frequent and repeated, can lead to permanent damage.",

    "description": "Mumps is an infection that spreads easily. It used to be common in children before the introduction of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Mumps usually clears within 1 or 2 weeks. Symptoms of mumps\\n\\n- The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after you're infected. Mumps causes painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands). It gives a distinctive 'hamster face' appearance. Other symptoms of mumps can include:\\n\\n- Headaches\\n- Joint pain\\n- Feeling sick\\n- Dry mouth\\n- Mild stomach (abdominal) pain\\n- Feeling tired\\n- Loss of appetite\\n- High temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F), or above\\n\\nThese may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands. Sometimes, mumps doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms. Most cases of mumps occur in people aged between 17 and 34 who have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Once you've had mumps, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It's highly unlikely you'll get it again.\\n\\nIf you have mumps:\\n- Stay off school or work for at least 5 days after your symptoms first develop\\n- Regularly wash your hands with soap\\n- Use and dispose of tissues when you sneeze\\n- Avoid close contact with anyone who isn't fully vaccinated",

People with Ménière's disease usually experience some or all of these symptoms during sudden attacks, which typically last around two to three hours, although it can take a day or two for the symptoms to disappear completely. It's worth noting, however, that the symptoms and severity of Ménière's disease vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience frequent attacks of vertigo along with hearing loss, while others may have severe tinnitus with minor vertigo. Other symptoms include sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis) or distorted sound.\\n\\nMénière's disease often progresses through different stages. In the early stages, most people have sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness. The attacks of vertigo continue, but may come and go and become less severe. It's common to experience a loss of balance or dizziness before or after these attacks. Permanent hearing loss and tinnitus continue to develop and may be worse during attacks of vertigo.\\n\\nDuring the later stages, the episodes of vertigo tend to occur less frequently and sometimes stop altogether over time. However, the tinnitus and hearing loss often become worse and you may be left with permanent balance and hearing problems.",

It usually affects the eyes first and may spread to other parts of the body. It can take weeks, months or years for symptoms to develop in other parts of the body. The severity of the symptoms is different for each person. It's likely that your symptoms will tend to get worse when you're tired. The symptoms might improve after resting. Symptoms can include:\\n\\n- Eyes\\n- Swallowing, speaking and breathing problems\\n- Limbs and neck weakness \\n- Double vision\\n\\nIt can be difficult to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. You might need several tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms before you can be diagnosed with myasthenia gravis.",

It's often difficult to recognize nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions. Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don't have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage. Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include:\\n\\n- A lump in the neck\\n- Hearing loss – usually only in 1 ear\\n- Tinnitus – hearing sounds that come from inside the body rather than from an outside source\\n- A blocked or stuffy nose\\n- Nosebleeds\\n\\nSpeak to your doctor if you develop any worrying symptoms, particularly if they don't improve after a few weeks. While they're very unlikely to be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, it's best to get them checked out. About 3 times as many men as women are affected by nasopharyngeal cancer.

    "condition": "Neuroblastoma: Children",
    "id": 98,
    "description": "Most children who have neuroblastoma are younger than 5 years old. It's the most common solid tumor in children that occurs outside of the brain and makes up 8% of the total number of children’s cancers. More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. It's devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organizations to help you through this difficult time. Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it's important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation. Neuroblastoma develops from the cells left behind from a baby’s development in the womb. The cells that it develops from are called neuroblasts.\\n\\n‘Neuro’ means nerve, ‘Blast’ means cells in early development ‘Oma’ means a group of cells, or a tumor.\\n\\nNeuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body. The site of origin is either in 1 of the 2 adrenal glands situated in the abdomen (tummy) or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The adrenal glands are specialized glands that are found above the right and left kidney. The adrenal glands normally release hormones to maintain blood pressure, and enable us to respond to stress. In some cases, neuroblastoma can spread to tissues beyond the original site such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver, and skin. The symptoms vary, depending on where your child’s neuroblastoma tumor is:\\n\\n- If the tumor is in the abdomen, your child’s tummy may be swollen and they may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine (peeing)\\n- if the tumor affects the chest area, your child may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing\\n- If the tumor occurs in the neck, it’s often visible as a lump and occasionally affects breathing and swallowing\\n- Occasionally, there are deposits of neuroblastoma in the skin that appear as small, blue-colored lumps\\n- If the tumor is pressing on the spinal cord, children may have weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily – if your child is not yet walking, you may notice reduced leg movements; they may also have constipation or difficulty passing urine (peeing)\\n- Your child may be found to have high blood pressure\\n- Very rarely, children may have jerky eye and muscle movements, and general unsteadiness associated with the neuroblastoma\\n- There are often symptoms of tiredness, being pale, loss of appetite, weight loss, bone pain and generalized discomfort.",

    "description": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It's usually seen in people who are overweight or obese. A healthy liver should contain little or no fat. It's estimated that up to 1 in every 3 people in the UK has early stages of NAFLD where there are small amounts of fat in their liver. Early-stage NAFLD doesn't usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including cirrhosis, if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of problems such as diabetes, heart attacks and strokes. If detected and managed at an early stage, it's possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver. NAFLD develops in 4 main stages. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realizing it. In small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed. The main stages of NAFLD are:\\n\\n1. Simple fatty liver (steatosis) – a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason\\n2. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)– a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population\\n3. Fibrosis – where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby blood vessels, but the liver is still able to function normally\\n4. Cirrhosis – the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and liver cancer\\n\\nIt can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse. You're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you:\\n\\n- Are obese or overweight – particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an 'apple-like' body shape)\\n- Have type 2 diabetes\\n- Have high blood pressure\\n- Have high cholesterol\\n- Are over the age of 50\\n- Smoke\\n\\nHowever, NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children. There aren't usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won't know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.",
